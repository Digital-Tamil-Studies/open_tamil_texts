<strong> Introduction</strong> <br/>
The Thiruvasagam is divided into 3 parts, each of which has many sections. The Tamil version on Project Madurai, which is followed here, numbers each stanza in order, indicated in the translation by a number in brackets at the end of the stanza. Sections 1-4 of part 1 each count as a stanza, and line numbers are given in those sections to correspond to the Project Madurai versions. After section 4 of part I, each stanza has two numbers: at the beginning the number in the section and at the end in brackets the cumulative number that corresponds to the number in Project Madurai (cf. PM releases #0003, #0094 and #0222). The English names given before each section are not a literal translation of the Tamil immediately before them but are intended to give the reader a better idea of the content of the section than a literal translation would.<br/>
<br/>
	Part I, The Lord of the Vedas. <br/>Sections 1-4 praise Lord Shiva in the traditional way. In section 5, a devotee asks for the lord’s help so that he can escape from his karma and future births. In section 6, a weak devotee praises the lord and ask him not to leave him. <br/> Part II, Dancing for the Dancer of Thillai.<br/> In sections 7 - 20 women praise the lord as they play. In it, various ceremonies are described that even today are followed in the worship of Shiva. <br/>
Part III, The Plea of the Devotee. <br/>In sections 21 -51 a devotee asks for the lord’s help so he can join him and leave this world.<br/><ul>

Let us praise the feet of the lord!<br/>

who does not leave my heart even for the wink of an eye.<br/>

He is one and many—let us worship his feet.<br/>

Let us praise the ornamented feet of Pinnagam that remove our future births.<br/>
Let us praise the beautiful feet of the lord<br/>
that cannot be reached by any who are not his devotees.<br/>

Let us praise his ornamented feet.<br/>
If his devotees bend their heads and worship him<br/>
he makes them famous—let us praise his feet.<br/>

Lord Shiva entered my heart and gave his grace—<br/>
I bow to his feet and worship them by his grace<br/>
and I recite the entire Shivapuranam<br/>
so that the karma of all will be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
21-30<br/>
The three-eyed lord came to me and showed his compassion<br/>
and I worshiped his matchless ornamented feet.<br/>
He is the sky, the earth, the bright light that spreads everywhere<br/>
and he has no limits.<br/>
I have done bad karma.<br/>
I do not know how to praise him.<br/>
I was born as a blade of grass, a bhutam, a worm, a tree,<br/>
many animals, a bird, a snake, a stone, a human, a demon<br/>
one of the ganas, a strong Asura, a sage, a god and all creatures<br/>
that act or do not act.<br/>
<br/>
31-40<br/>
I was born as all things on this earth and I am tired.<br/>
O lord, I found your golden feet and reached moksha.<br/>
You stay in my mind as “Om” and protect me.<br/>
O lord, you are the truth, the faultless one, the rider on a bull,<br/>
and you are deep and wide yet small like an atom.<br/>
The Vedas praise you saying, “You are our master!”<br/>
O faultless lord, you are heat and cold,<br/>
the true wisdom that removes all the false deeds of your devotees,<br/>
a shining bright light and excellent knowledge that give us grace.<br/>
O lord, you are my joy!<br/>
I am not wise, and you are the good knowledge<br/>
that removes my ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
41 -60<br/>
You have no beginning or end and you cannot be measured.<br/>
You create the whole world, protect and destroy it,<br/>
you give your grace to the world, take creatures of the world<br/>
to your world and make them worship you.<br/>
You stay far and near and you are the fragrance in all things.<br/>
You are the lord of the Vedas, filled with knowledge.<br/>
You stay in the hearts of your dear devotees<br/>
like honey mixed with fresh milk, sugar and ghee.<br/>
O great lord, remove the future births of your devotees.<br/>
O lord with five colors,<br/>
you hid when the gods in the sky searched for you.<br/>
<br/>
You gave me a body to me that is a hut filled with dirt<br/>
and that has done bad and good karma.<br/>
Its inside is bound by virtue and sin<br/>
and its outside is covered with skin.<br/>
The five senses do wicked things<br/>
and my body wants to do everything that my senses<br/>
want it to do.<br/>
<br/>
O faultless one, my heart melts with love for you.<br/>
Even though I am like an animal my heart melts with love for you,<br/>
and have not done any good.<br/>
You came to this earth, showed me your ornamented body<br/>
and gave me your grace to me who am lower than a dog.<br/>
<br/>
61-70<br/>
<br/>
O lord, you, the truth, showed me love more than a mother.<br/>
You are a faultless light, a blooming bright flower,<br/>
our bright lord, our friend and sweet honey.<br/>
You, the god of Shivapuram,<br/>
removed my bond with the earth,<br/>
you protect me and give me your loving grace.<br/>
<br/>
O lord, you, a flood of compassion,<br/>
removed the wickedness from my mind,<br/>
You are our nectar that is always sweet.<br/>
O limitless lord, you do not appear<br/>
before those who do not think of you.<br/>
You melted my heart<br/>
and stay in my heart giving me life.<br/>
<br/>
71-80<br/>
Though you have no happiness or sorrow,<br/>
you can be happy or sorrowful.<br/>
O lord, friend of those who think of you as their friend,<br/>
you are everything and you are nothing,<br/>
you are brightness and darkness, and you were never born.<br/>
You, the ancient one, are the end and middle yet you are neither.<br/>
O father, you took me to you and made me yours.<br/>
<br/>
Even those wise ones who know many things do not know you.<br/>
O lord, virtuous one, you are not born on the earth<br/>
and you do not leave it.<br/>
O lord, light that no one can see,<br/>
you are our protector and take care of us.<br/>
You are the joyful flood of a river,<br/>
O lord, you are light that will never diminish,<br/>
and the deep feeling in our hearts.<br/>
<br/>
81-95<br/>
O lord, faultless wisdom on his earth, knowledge, clarity,<br/>
nectar that springs in the hearts of your devotees,<br/>
you made me yours.<br/>
Your devotees praise you saying,<br/>
“My body is becoming weak and I will not be able to bear it.”<br/>
You are my chief, O Shiva, save me.<br/>
<br/>
Your devotees praise you<br/>
and ask for the boon of not being born on the earth.<br/>
You destroy our false bodies<br/>
and our births so we will not be born and suffer.<br/>
O lord, king of southern Pandya country,<br/>
you dance in the golden hall in Thillai at midnight.<br/>
<br/>
You destroy the births that give us sorrow.<br/>
Devotees worship you and say you cannot be described,<br/>
as they exclaim, “O king of the southern Pandya country,<br/>
dancer in the golden hall of Thillai,<br/>
you destroy the births that give us sorrow.”<br/>
Those who sing your praise in songs and know their meaning<br/>
will reach Shivapuram and abide beneath your feet<br/>
where all other devotees will praise them and bow to them. 95<br/>

Praise the lord as the creator of the world<br/>
<br/>
1-28<br/>
The lord has the form of the world<br/>
that can not be measured.<br/>
He is more beautiful than hundreds of crores of lights.<br/>
He is small like an atom yet he is large.<br/>
He created Brahma, the creator of the world,<br/>
and he creates and protects all creatures of the world<br/>
and he also ends their lives.<br/>
The world moves as if it were caught in a storm<br/>
and he makes it function.<br/>
<br/>
He is the lord of all the six religions and their principles<br/>
and he is moksha for all, even the gods.<br/>
Every day he gives light to the sun, coolness to the moon,<br/>
heat to fire and purity to the wide sky.<br/>
He makes the wind blow and gives water its sweet taste.<br/>
He creates the earth and the many crores of things in it.<br/>
<br/>
29-36<br/>
<br/>
He is ancient, matchless, the whole universe.<br/>
He wears the teeth of a boar and a tiger skin.<br/>
He is smeared with white ashes.<br/>
Whenever I think of him,<br/>
I am unable to bear the thought<br/>
that I have not reached him.<br/>
He, the creator of the music of the veena, is also its music. 35<br/>
<br/>
37-50<br/>
He is ancient, the highest one<br/>
and could not be found by Brahma and Thirumal.<br/>
He is a wonder and many who can't be described in words.<br/>
The mind cannot know him but he can be caught in the net of devotion.<br/>

Scholars cannot recognize him.<br/>
The lord who has no birth or ending<br/>
creates all relationships in the world and moksha.<br/>
Lord Shiva is all moving and unmoving creatures—<br/>
even the gods do not know him..<br/>
He is female, male and ali.<br/>
I saw the god with my own eyes,<br/>
the compassionate lord who is nectar and gives his grace to all.<br/>
<br/>
61- 65<br/>
He came to earth to make his devotees his.<br/>
I am sure he is the god Shiva.<br/>
He made me his and gave his grace to me.<br/>
He is joined with Uma<br/>
whose beautiful eyes are like kuvalai blossoms—<br/>
she is half his body.<br/>
<br/>
66-95<br/>
As if he were a dark cloud,<br/>
the god took water from the ocean of divine joy<br/>
and climbed the mountain in Thirupperundurai.<br/>
Then lightning spread in all directions,<br/>
snakes that have five senses ran away,<br/>
the hot season made the trees dry,<br/>
beautiful kandal flowers bloomed,<br/>
indragopa insects swarmed everywhere,<br/>
and lotuses bloomed with petals that were like kandal blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
The flood of his grace spread in all directions.<br/>
Thirsty deer drank water, 
rivers flooded and crashed on their banks,<br/>
rain fell and cooled the heat<br/>
beautiful flowers bloomed,<br/>
kandal buds looked like the folded hands of devotees,<br/>
butterflies flew everywhere,<br/>
thunder roared,<br/>
water like the wisdom of knowledge filled up the ponds<br/>
and crashed on their banks,<br/>
and trees fell like our bad karma.<br/>
<br/>
As if they were deer thirsty for drink,<br/>
good devotees drink in the meaning of the six religions.<br/>
As if they were performing archana for the gods,<br/>
farmers lovingly plant their crops in the earth.<br/>
May the god of the universe who is like a cloud prosper.<br/>

When I become a devotee of the lord<br/>
I feel his flood of joy all over my body.<br/>
I do not want this body—I want to join him.<br/>
<br/>
Omnipresent lord could not be found by devotees. 123 - 132<br/>
<br/>
He is a heap of emeralds and shines brightly.<br/>
He was not found by Brahma who has heads in all four directions.<br/>
Those who tried hard to see him could not find him.<br/>
All the sages tried to find him, but could not.<br/>
Even those who concentrated only on him could not find him<br/>
and felt disappointed.<br/>
Those who learned all the Vedas and searched for him could not find him.<br/>
Those who thought they could find him in tantras<br/>
could not find him even in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
133 - 141<br/>
He is unique.<br/>
He has the form of a male, a female and an ali<br/>
and all the gods were unable to find him.<br/>
He shares his body with his wife who has shining forehead.<br/>
He was not found by sages who controlled their five senses,<br/>
left all their pleasures of the world,<br/>
and did penance with their thin bodies.<br/>
No one knows whether he is or he is not or whether he is one thing.<br/>
I, his devotee, finally found that thief who hid himself.<br/>
<br/>
142 - 145<br/>
He hid himself from all those who worship him saying,<br/>
“Praise him, praise him, adorn him with garlands,<br/>
go round him and worship him,<br/>
follow him, do not leave him, hold on to him!”<br/>
<br/>
146 -157<br/>
The matchless lord with a unique nature<br/>
calls us, his devotees, and makes us his.<br/>
He shows us his Vedic form and gives his grace.<br/>
I worshiped him crying and calling out.<br/>
I felt as if I were caught in the waves of the ocean,<br/>
had fallen into it, rolled about and cried.<br/>
I felt like a crazy man and became like a maniac.<br/>
People were scared to see me<br/>
and those who heard me were amazed.<br/>
I was like a mad elephant as I suffered.<br/>
I do not enjoy the feelings of five senses.<br/>
<br/>
158 - 167<br/>
In the cities of his enemies he is like a fire that destroys them,<br/>
but he is like a nellikkani on my palm.<br/>
I do not know how to praise him.<br/>
Is this right for him?<br/>
I cannot survive without him.<br/>
I do not know what he wants me to do<br/>
or how to get his grace,<br/>
and even if I receive it, I do not have enough of it.<br/>
Even if I swallow it, it is not enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
168 - 182<br/>
He filled my heart with nectar from the cool milky ocean roaring with waves.<br/>
I am a dog yet he made my body fill with nectar.<br/>
He made it as if nectar and sweet honey<br/>
were flowing all through my flesh and bones.<br/>
He makes me melt for him and makes my body pure.<br/>
I am like an elephant that looks for sugarcane and vilam fruit.<br/>
His grace and compassion flow through my body like honey<br/>
and have made me his.<br/>
He is the lord whom even Brahma could not find.<br/>

<center><h3> 4. Potritthiruvahaval </h3></center>

1 - 30<br/>
<br/>
As Brahma and all the gods in the sky worshiped you,<br/>
Thirumal, praised by sages everywhere,<br/>
who wears a silver crown and measured the three worlds with his two feet,<br/>
wanted to find your feet, and, disguised as a boar,<br/>
split open the earth and looked for them,<br/>
but, unable to find them and exhausted,<br/>
he praised you, saying, “Jeya, Jeya!”<br/>
You are easy to find for your devotees<br/>
if they worship you on this earth<br/>
surrounded with wide ocean.<br/>
<br/>
In this world where elephants and ants are born,<br/>
I was born from the faultless womb of a mother<br/>
unaffected by any of her impurities.<br/>
After I was born for the first, the second and third month<br/>
I survived, but in the fourth month, I lived in darkness,<br/>
in the fifth month I was breathing well,<br/>
in the sixth month all the neighbors came to see me<br/>
and gossiped about how I look,<br/>
in the seventh month, I crawled,<br/>
in the eighth and ninth months I lived without any trouble,<br/>
in the tenth month I slept with my mother<br/>
and so I grew up year after year.<br/>
In the morning I did all the things I had to do,<br/>
in the day I was hungry always,<br/>
and in the night I slept. That is how I lived.<br/>
<br/>
31 - 59<br/>

When I was young I lived in this crazy world like a mad elephant,<br/>
falling in love with women as beautiful as peacocks,<br/>
with dark curly hair, red mouths, round breasts and sharp eyes.<br/>
I learned from an ocean of books.<br/>
Impoverished, I needed to earn wealth and suffered in many ways.<br/>
I began to understand fate<br/>
and I also began to understand all the magical things in life.<br/>
Relatives and neighbors joined together and gossiped about me.<br/>
They talked of atheism.<br/>
Friends and others called me constantly just to talk<br/>
and wanted to go to places with me.<br/>
Those who know the shastras told me<br/>
that I should do vrathas and described the rules of shastras to me.<br/>
I heard scholars of many schools<br/>
when they argued and fought about various philosophies.<br/>
The people belonging to Ulogayudam surrounded me like snakes<br/>
and many other illusionary things also surrounded me.<br/>
<br/>
60- 77<br/>
But I only wanted to be your devotee,<br/>
and I was like a candle that is near the fire and is not moved away.<br/>
I worshiped you and melted in my heart for you.<br/>
I cried, my body shivering,<br/>
I danced, screamed, sang and praised you.<br/>
My heart melted in devotion like a nail piercing a soft tree<br/>
and swelled like an ocean.<br/>
My body shivered and the world looked at me and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
I was not ashamed for whatever they said<br/>
and accepted their words as if they were ornaments.<br/>
I did not give up my desire to see you<br/>
and the joy that I might see you increased.<br/>
I was crying and troubled<br/>
and did not want to think of any other god.<br/>
I understood that you are the only highest god<br/>
and you came to the earth, became my dear guru<br/>
and gave me your grace.<br/>
<br/>
78- 85.<br/>
I do not think of your greatness as a simple thing.<br/>
I feel like a shadow that does not move from your grace.<br/>
I consider the direction of the lord without growing tired.<br/>
My bones melt and I long for you.<br/>
The river of love for you flows over its banks.<br/>
All of my senses look for you.<br/>
I cry out, “Lord, lord!”<br/>
My words are confused?<br/>
My body shivers.<br/>
I fold my hands and my heart blooms in devotion for you.<br/>
My eyes feel joy and fill with tears.<br/>
<br/>

5. Thiruchadagam [5-104] </h3></center>
<strong>5.1. Mey Uṇartal</strong><br/>
<br/>
1. When I worship you my body trembles.<br/>
I shiver, putting my hands on my head,<br/>
and worship your fragrant feet.<br/>
My eyes fill with tears and my heart melts.<br/>
I praise you truly and I say, “Jeya jeya potri!”<br/>
Be compassionate to me and do not leave me,<br/>
Take care of me. [5]<br/>
<br/>
2. I do not want the lives of Indra, Brahma or Thirumal.<br/>
Even if my family is destroyed,<br/>
I will not lose the love that I have for you devotees.<br/>
Even if I have to go to hell I will not mock your devotees.<br/>
I want to have your grace—<br/>
O lord, I will not think of any other god except you, O best one. [6]<br/>
<br/>
3. If I think and melt for the lord, the finest one,<br/>
and worship his feet, he will make me his.<br/>
People think and say he is Thirumal<br/>
or whoever they wish their god to be.<br/>
They wander everywhere thinking<br/>
that this one or that one is god<br/>
and they say whatever they want.<br/>
When I will leave this world and come to you? [7]<br/>
<br/>
4. The gods who ate the sacrificial food<br/>
from Daksha’s sacrifice were frightened and ran to you<br/>
and asked you to save them.<br/>
In their pride, all thought Thirumal, Brahma and Rudra<br/>
are the gods of the earth and heaven<br/>
and they wandered about everywhere.<br/>
What a pity! [8]<br/>
<br/>
5. I have not done any tapas.<br/>
I did not sprinkle cool flowers on your feet and worship you.<br/>
I have done many wrong things and collected bad karma.<br/>
O Shiva, I did not do all the good things<br/>
that your devotees have done.<br/>
I want to reach your feet.<br/>
Give me your grace.<br/>
I am your slave, you are the highest god. [9]<br/>
<br/>
6. O lord, you are a thief,<br/>
If your devotees sprinkle flowers on your feet<br/>
and ask for all they want,<br/>
you will not hide from their loving hearts<br/>
and you will give whatever they want.<br/>
Give me your grace and that same love<br/>
so that I may worship your ornamented feet<br/>
and praise you always. [10]<br/>
<br/>
7. He created Brahma who created the whole world.<br/>
When he took a form spanning earth and sky,<br/>
Thirumal who had sprinkled flowers before on his feet<br/>
went under the earth as a boar and searched for his feet,<br/>
but the lord who did not show himself to Thirumal.<br/>
He dances in the burning ground,<br/>
acting as if he does not have anyone, wearing a tiger skin<br/>
and unmatham flowers and wandering everywhere. [11]<br/>
<br/>
8. O lord, when will the time come<br/>
when wind, fire, water, the earth<br/>
and the sky are destroyed and you dance?<br/>
Will you protect me then and remove all my bad karma?<br/>
Will you protect me so I will not be born and collect karma again? [12]<br/>
<br/>
9. My lord in whose hair the cool moon floats created the world.<br/>
He is the god of the gods in the sky.<br/>
He is Shiva, my lord.<br/>
Even though I have done many mean things, he made me his.<br/>
He is my lord and I am just his slave—<br/>
how could he give me the goodness of being his devotee?<br/>
O world, tell me. [13]<br/>
<br/>
10. O faultless jewel-like lord, 
I am not suitable to be one of your devotees,<br/>
but you made me one.<br/>
You give your grace to low people like me<br/>
and make the gods in the sky debased.<br/>
I can only laugh when I see your mischief. [14]<br/>
--------<br/>
<strong>5.2. Arivuruthal</strong><br/>
<br/>
11. I act in this world as if I were in a play with all others.<br/>
I hurry to enter moksha.<br/>
You are a shining diamond hill.<br/>
Give me the grace to love you always<br/>
and make my heart melt for you.<br/>
O lord, you make me yours. [15]<br/>
<br/>
12. I am not afraid of being born again,<br/>
I am not afraid of death.<br/>
Even if someone offers me the sky and the world,<br/>
I do not want them.<br/>
I will not respect any kings who rule the earth.<br/>
O Shiva, my lord, my father,<br/>
adorned with a kondrai garland dripping with honey,<br/>
my only worry is when will the day come that I get your grace. [16]<br/>
<br/>
13. I am worried and long to see your lotus feet.<br/>
I am like a dog and have not sprinkled flowers on your feet and worshiped you.<br/>
My tongue has not recited your names.<br/>
You bent Meru mountain and used it as a bow.<br/>
If you do not give your grace of nectar, I will suffer.<br/>
I am alone—what else can I do? [17]<br/>
<br/>
14. My heart does not melt because I have not reached your divine feet.<br/>
I have not melted with love for you.<br/>
I have not decorated you with flower garlands, praised you and worshiped you.<br/>
You are the god of gods.<br/>
I have not cleaned and smeared your beautiful temple.<br/>
I have not danced there.<br/>
I am hurrying to get moksha.<br/>
I want to dance and join you. [18]<br/>
<br/>
15. You are the sky.<br/>
You are the earth.<br/>
You are the wind.<br/>
You are the life of all creatures.<br/>
You are what is and what is not.<br/>
You are the king.<br/>
You make everyone think of “me” and “mine.”<br/>
You make them act in this world yet you stay above all. [19]<br/>
<br/>
16. The gods in the sky praise you and you protect them.<br/>
They worship you so that all people will worship them<br/>
and they can think they are privileged.<br/>
O lord adorned with garlands swarming with bees,<br/>
I a dog and your slave.<br/>
I worship you so that I will not be born again. [20]<br/>
<br/>
17. The gods in the sky praise you.<br/>
The four Vedas sing your praise.<br/>
Uma, adorned with kura flowers, shares half of your body.<br/>
Your true devotees think of you with love.<br/>
Will they see your feet ornamented with sounding anklets?<br/>
You are hard to know. [21]<br/>
<br/>
18. You are hard for anyone to know.<br/>
You dance in the hall in Thillai.<br/>
You are the highest.<br/>
I am a low one yet you made me yours.<br/>
I do not sprinkle flowers on your fragrant feet.<br/>
I do not wonder about and cry for you.<br/>
My heart does not melt for you.<br/>
I just cannot live here, I cannot live here. [22]<br/>
<br/>
19. O heart, you shiver and melt<br/>
for the flower arrows shot by Kama, god of spring,<br/>
and for women with white teeth, red mouths<br/>
and dark eyes like kuvalai flowers.<br/>
O heart, the lord melted you and entered you.<br/>
He is in the sky, but you do not know it<br/>
and just live in this world in vain. [23]<br/>
<br/>
20. O heart, you live on this earth making your bad karma grow,<br/>
and you do not praise the lord<br/>
who can release you from the results of your bad acts.<br/>
I kept on telling you not to live like this,<br/>
but again and again you plunge into bad karma<br/>
and the flood of its sorrowful ocean. [24]<br/>
--------------<br/>
<strong>5.3. Cutturuthal</strong><br/>
<br/>
21. Your devotees praise you saying,<br/>
“The Ganges flows in your jata and you ride on a bull.<br/>
You are the god of the gods in the sky.”<br/>
Their devotion is like a flood flowing down into a valley.<br/>
They pant, melt and wait for your grace.<br/>
Even though I have not melted for you from head to feet,<br/>
you made me yours,<br/>
yet my eyes do not shed tears of flood for you.<br/>
My lord, my heart is like stone, my eyes are like wood,<br/>
I have done bad karma. [25]<br/>
<br/>
22. When I was suffering with the results of bad karma,<br/>
you came to me and said, “I will remove your karma”<br/>
and made me yours.<br/>
You are my lord and I am like a doll made of iron.<br/>
I do not sing and praise you, I do not dance for you,<br/>
I do not scream and babble your praise. I am tired.<br/>
O ancient lord, is it right for me to be like this?<br/>
I do not know how I will end.<br/>
You are the beginning and the end. [26]<br/>
<br/>
23. I know you are the lord of the four Vedas.<br/>
I am a dog, lower than anyone,<br/>
yet still I say, ‘”I am your devotee.”<br/>
You made me your devotee—<br/>
do you have no other devotees?<br/>
I am a devil.<br/>
It is your greatness that you accepted me as your devotee. [27]<br/>
<br/>
24. O my lord, what should I say to praise you?<br/>
I say of you always, again and again,<br/>
“You are my mother and father and my lord!”<br/>
I wear divine ashes and praise you.<br/>
O lord who remove the birth and death of your devotees,<br/>
you are a faultless jewel mountain.<br/>
O my father, I am a thief and I suffer, plunged into the flood of desire,<br/>
but you made me yours.<br/>
How could you make me your devotee? [28]<br/>
<br/>
25. The gods in the sky praise you, saying<br/>
“Your color is not red,<br/>
your color is not white,<br/>
you are many, you are one,<br/>
You are smaller than an atom.”<br/>
They do not know what you are and are confused.<br/>
O my father, you showed me your form,<br/>
your color and your lotus feet ornamented with jewels.<br/>
I do not have anyone.<br/>
You removed my future births.<br/>
You are my lord—what should I say and think of you? [29]<br/>
<br/>
26. You make me think only of you.<br/>
I am a dog yet you make me praise your lotus feet<br/>
and allow my eyes see them.<br/>
You make me have beautiful words to praise you.<br/>
You remove the desires of my five senses and enter my heart.<br/>
You are the nectar from the large ocean.<br/>
O mountain, you gave me yourself.<br/>
Your body is like a forest of red lotuses.<br/>
O unique shining light<br/>
there is no more me and you, we are together. [30]<br/>
<br/>
27. I am alone.<br/>
I suffer pushed by the waves of the ocean of karma and rebirth.<br/>
I do not have anything to hold on to.<br/>
I am caught by passion that swallows me like a sura fish<br/>
for women who have sweet mouths red as coral<br/>
and I suffer like someone struggling in a wind.<br/>
I wondered how I might escape—<br/>
I hold on to the boat that is your five letter mantra, “Namachivaaya”<br/>
and live on the earth.<br/>
O ancient lord, you showed me the shore that is moksha of the ocean of birth<br/>
and moksha has no beginning or end.<br/>
I am a stupid person yet you made me yours. [31]<br/>
<br/>
28. No one has heard of him.<br/>
No one knows him.<br/>
He is faultless.<br/>
He has no relatives.<br/>
He knows everything and hears everything.<br/>
Your devotees wait for you sleeplessly.<br/>
I am like a dog yet you put me up on a seat,<br/>
made me your devotee<br/>
and showed me things that you have never shown to anyone.<br/>
You made me hear things that no one has ever heard.<br/>
You removed my future births and made me yours.<br/>
What a wonder you do for me! [32]<br/>
<br/>
29. Have you heard of a wonder like this anywhere?<br/>
He made me the devotee of his dear devotees,<br/>
removed my fears and made me his.<br/>
The nectar of his love springs in my heart.<br/>
He is my father,<br/>
and he is man, woman, ali, sky, blazing fire and the end of all.<br/>
He stays above the earth and has the color of vetchi flower.<br/>
He is my lord Shiva, the god of gods. [33]<br/>
<br/>
30. He is the god of gods unknown even to Indra, the king of the gods.<br/>
He is the king of the three gods<br/>
who create, protect and destroy all the flourishing worlds.<br/>
His wife is half of his body.<br/>
He is the king of all yet he came to me and made me his.<br/>
We are not slaves of anyone, we are not afraid of anything.<br/>
We join the devotees of his devotees.<br/>
Let us be happy and dance in the flood devotion that he is. [34]<br/>
---------------<br/>
<strong>5.4. Atmacutti</strong><br/>
<br/>
31. O heart, you do not dance praising his ornamented feet,<br/>
you do not love him,<br/>
you do not sing his praise, your bones melting,<br/>
you do not feel anxious,<br/>
you do not worship his lotus feet,<br/>
you do not put flowers on his feet,<br/>
you do not search for him or wander calling out his names on the streets.<br/>
I do not know what to do. [35]<br/>
<br/>
32. O, heart, I am ignorant.<br/>
My father, the lord, entered my heart,<br/>
gave me his grace, showed me the good path<br/>
and made me be rid of the desires of the world.<br/>
You received his grace,<br/>
but you play in the world enjoying it.<br/>
You make yourself low.<br/>
You spoiled me and made me low. [36]<br/>
<br/>
33. O ignorant heart,<br/>
you oppose all my good thoughts and spoil me.<br/>
I do not trust you.<br/>
I have caught Shiva tightly<br/>
yet even after you have seen the divine ashes on his arms,<br/>
you do not melt and become soft.<br/>
This body is something false.<br/>
You only ruin me.<br/>
I will not listen to you. [37]<br/>
<br/>
34. O playful heart, you are no good.<br/>
He made me his, his dog-like slave.<br/>
He is the lord of all kinds of tricks.<br/>
Even though you are separated from his fragrant lotus feet<br/>
that are like tender shoots, I cannot describe<br/>
the good knowledge and greatness he gave you. [38]<br/>
<br/>
35. O heart, no one can tell how great he is.<br/>
He is easy to reach for his devotees.<br/>
He removed your wickedness and made you his.<br/>
Even after you knew his compassion,<br/>
you did not give up your bad qualities,<br/>
you did not make yourself a place for him enter and abide.<br/>
O heart, you are not faultless<br/>
and you have not bowed to the ornamented feet<br/>
of the lord who made you his.<br/>
How could you enter his moksha? [39]<br/>
<br/>
36. I am unable to stop being born on this earth<br/>
and cannot leave it.<br/>
I cannot enter the golden world of the lord<br/>
or melt in my heart in love for the feet of my god.<br/>
I cannot have the devotion<br/>
that is like sweet nectar, honey and milk and nourish it.<br/>
What should I do to receive these things?<br/>
I have done bad karma. [40]<br/>
<br/>
37. Are there any others who have done bad karma as I have?<br/>
He should not think that I am a dog and could be without him.<br/>
But though I am separated from the ancient lord's lotus feet<br/>
I have not hit my head in desperation.<br/>
My feelings are like iron,<br/>
my heart is like a stone and I am unable to hear anything.<br/>
I do not know why these things are happening. [41]<br/>
<br/>
38. Shiva is honey, pure ghee from a cow,<br/>
and clear sweet sugar juice.<br/>
No one but his true devotees can reach him<br/>
and even they do not know who he is.<br/>
He is the king of his world<br/>
and half of him is his doe-eyed wife.<br/>
I have not joined him—I only look after this body.<br/>
I am destroyed yet I am still alive. [42]<br/>
<br/>
39. He has no end and cannot be compared with anything.<br/>
I am low, worse than a dog, yet he showed me the good path<br/>
and gave his sweet grace like a mother.<br/>
He is my lord but I have not seen him.<br/>
I have not fallen into fire like other devotees,<br/>
I have not fallen and rolled down a hill,<br/>
I have not plunged into the ocean—<br/>
what should I do? [43]<br/>
<br/>
40. When the arrows of Kama tear my heart,<br/>
my mind will be destroyed,<br/>
but I do not understand that<br/>
and fall for the doe-like glances of women<br/>
making my heart suffer like curd churned by a churning stick.<br/>
Shiva has given me his divine honey-like grace<br/>
but I do not try to enter his world.<br/>
I eat, dress and stay in this world<br/>
tending to my body of flesh. [44]<br/>
-------------<br/>
<strong>5.5. Kaimaru Koduthal</strong><br/>
<br/>
41. My heart is like an elephant with two trunks.<br/>
I have not seen the lord, origin of the world,<br/>
and all I know is trouble.<br/>
You called me to come to you but I am not able to—<br/>
I want only to live in this world and enjoy life.<br/>
You are the highest among the gods in the sky. [45]<br/>
<br/>
42. Your devotees sense that there is something that is highest,<br/>
but they do not know whether it is female, male or ali.<br/>
You came to me your devotee and gave your true presence.<br/>
Even though I saw you, I do not know you.<br/>
What is this magic? [46]<br/>
<br/>
43. Even the gods in the sky<br/>
do not know you with your lovely form.<br/>
You are the dancer who made me yours,<br/>
you are the world, you are the sky,<br/>
and you are time that comes and goes.<br/>
When can I see you? [47]<br/>
<br/>
44. You are the highest and no one can see you.<br/>
I am like a little bird, a low Paanan<br/>
and I do not know how to see you<br/>
leaving this body and the pleasures of my senses. [48]<br/>
<br/>
45. I do not praise you or roll on the ground to worship you,<br/>
I do not speak of your fame or call to you with love,<br/>
but I want to go against my own desires<br/>
and come before you and worship your lotus feet.<br/>
I want to be like Yama who opposed you<br/>
but was able only to worship your feet. [49]<br/>
<br/>
46. He is adorned with a kondrai flower garland<br/>
swarming with bees and dripping with honey.<br/>
Will he call me, make me join his devotees<br/>
and make me do his service.<br/>
My father is omnipresent and stays above the sky,<br/>
under the world and everywhere inside the world.<br/>
He is like the oil in a sesame seed and we cannot see him. [50]<br/>
<br/>
47. My lord is my father and mother<br/>
and the father and mother of all,<br/>
but he has no father or mother.<br/>
No one can understand that dear one through knowledge.<br/>
Before he entered anyone else, he entered my heart. [51]<br/>
<br/>
48. He does not discriminate between poor and wealthy,<br/>
gods, worms and grass—he gives his grace to all.<br/>
I am separated from that wonderful god<br/>
and do not worship his great ornamented feet even though I saw them.<br/>
My heart is like a stone and I have only trouble. [52]<br/>
<br/>
49. You released me from all my troubles.<br/>
You made me wear divine white ashes<br/>
and made me part of the assembly of your dear devotees<br/>
so all would accept me as your devotee.<br/>
I am ignorant of the ten things--<br/>
water, fire, earth, wind, sky, sun, moon, breath,<br/>
Shivam and Shakthi. [53]<br/>
<br/>
50. Your form is knowledge<br/>
and you are sweet nectar.<br/>
I, your slave, am a dog.<br/>
Was it stupid of you to make me yours?<br/>
Tell me, am I wise or not?<br/>
Give me your grace. [54]<br/>
-------------<br/>
<strong>5.6. Anupokacutti</strong><br/>
<br/>
51. O lord Esaa, you are my chief, my father and god.<br/>
You released me from my future births.<br/>
I, a low person, am a wicked dog and I have no one to depend on<br/>
yet I do not think of you who made me yours.<br/>
See, you are my love, dancer in the hall of Thillai.<br/>
I do not know what to do. [55]<br/>
<br/>
52. I am a small dog and do not know what to do.<br/>
I have not seen your golden lotus feet,<br/>
living in this world like someone who tells lies.<br/>
Even though I heard of and saw<br/>
those who do not tell lies and reach your fragrant lotus feet,<br/>
I am a liar and I eat, dress and live in this world,<br/>
O lord, fighting lion. [56]<br/>
<br/>
53. O lord, fighting lion, I saw you leaving your golden heaven<br/>
and coming to the earth with your wife who has young soft breasts.<br/>
I saw your good devotees join your feet and receive your grace,<br/>
yet even after seeing them,<br/>
I stay in this world like a blind cow wandering in a village.<br/>
I am cruel—won’t I leave this world? [57]<br/>
<br/>
54. Many sages do penance for a long time,<br/>
ignore their bodies, become weak and wait to see you.<br/>
But you made me, a sinner, your servant,<br/>
yet I did not leave this dirty body.<br/>
O jewel! I do not have enough love to search for you.<br/>
How I am going to reach you, my dear lord? [58]<br/>
<br/>
55. You share your body with doe-eyed Uma.<br/>
You made me yours on this earth.<br/>
O lord Shiva, sweet as honey, nectar and clear sugarcane juice,<br/>
king of southern Thillai,<br/>
the devotees who understand you have joined your ornamented feet<br/>
but I protect this body, which is like a cage for worms,<br/>
and stay in this world. Is this right?<br/>
You have made me yours. [59]<br/>
<br/>
56. O lord, the devotees who think of you<br/>
and melt in their hearts growing in love for you<br/>
have joined your feet, and you have made them yours.<br/>
I see them but I am like a low village dog<br/>
and my heart does not melt for you.<br/>
I am ignorant and my body is a nest of worms<br/>
and smells like rotten meat.<br/>
You make me stay in this world. [60]<br/>
<br/>
57. Is it right that you keep me away from you?<br/>
I have not taken the path of devotion like your dear devotees.<br/>
I am a thief.<br/>
I have involved myself with women, whose mouths throb,<br/>
clothes slip down and faces are marked by small drops of sweat,<br/>
yet even so I suffer to receive your love. [61]<br/>
<br/>
58. He is honey, milk and clear sugarcane juice.<br/>
He makes his devotees his and melts their hearts.<br/>
He is the lord of the sky.<br/>
I wonder—is it a joke that you gave me your grace and made me yours?<br/>
Is it your character to laugh yet still give your grace to your devotees? [62]<br/>
<br/>
59. O lord, no one knows you.<br/>
I am a low person, a dog, yet you made me yours.<br/>
O master, if you leave me now who will protect me?<br/>
What will I do? You are my god.<br/>
Your divine body shines like gold.<br/>
You are my mother—where can I go for refuge? [63]<br/>
<br/>
60. I surrendered to your feet and joined the devotees<br/>
who praise you and I laugh at my condition?<br/>
I gaze at your arms shamelessly.<br/>
I am a shameless dog and do not melt in love for you.<br/>
I am not the right person for you to make yours—<br/>
when I think of this I laugh.<br/>
You are my father, I cannot bear to live like this. [64]<br/>
-----------<br/>
<strong>5.7. Karuniyattal Irangal</strong><br/>
<br/>
61. I will not bear life on this earth.<br/>
O Sankara, I praise you, Viruthanee, I praise you.<br/>
O young one, I praise you, O, matchless one, I praise you.<br/>
You are the lord of the gods, I praise you.<br/>

You, the generous one, made me yours—<br/>
even though I lie, I praise you.<br/>
I worship your feet, I praise you.<br/>
O chief, I praise you, I praise you.<br/>
You are a flood of compassion, I praise you.<br/>
You are the sweet earth, water, fire, wind, life,<br/>
the sky, the sun and moon. [67]<br/>
<br/>
64. O god, I praise you.<br/>
Look at me and give me your grace, I praise you.<br/>
Remove my desires for this world and make me yours, I praise you.<br/>
Release me from this body<br/>
and make me join the gods in the sky, I praise you.<br/>

<br/>
65. O Sankara, I praise you.<br/>
I have no refuge, I praise you.<br/>
You share your body with your young wife<br/>
who has sharp dark shining eyes,<br/>
a red mouth and a waist like a snake, I praise you.<br/>
You ride on a white bull, I praise you.<br/>
I will not be able to live on his earth without you—<br/>
O lord, I am tired. [69]<br/>
<br/>
66. You are my lord, I am tired, I praise you.<br/>
I blame you, I praise you.<br/>
I worship your feet and you made me yours, I worship you.<br/>
Isn’t the duty of great ones,<br/>
to forgive the faults of the young? I praise you.<br/>
Take me away from this life, I praise you.<br/>
You are the king of the sky, I praise you. [70]<br/>
<br/>
67. My dear lord, I praise you.<br/>
You are the bull of the gods in the sky, I praise you.<br/>
You share your body with your young wife<br/>
who whose waist is thin as a vine, I praise you.<br/>
You wear white ashes, I praise you.<br/>
You are red, I praise you.<br/>
You dance in the sacred hall of Thillai, I praise you.<br/>
You are the king of the gods in the sky, I praise you.<br/>
O my unique lord, you make me yours, I praise you. [71]<br/>
<br/>
68. You are unique, I praise you.<br/>
O father, you are matchless, I praise you.<br/>
You are the guru of the gods in the sky, I praise you.<br/>
You are our tender beautiful shoot, I praise you.<br/>
Order me to come to you, I praise you.<br/>
Give me your feet, I praise you.<br/>
Take away my loneliness, I praise you. [72]<br/>
<br/>
69. You are the friend of those who love you dearly.<br/>
You remove my lies, give me your grace<br/>
and make me yours, I praise you.<br/>
You drank the poison that came from the milky ocean<br/>
and gave the nectar to the gods, I praise you.<br/>
Give this dog, your slave, your feet and your grace. [73]<br/>
<br/>
70. You are earth, water, fire, wind and sky, I praise you.<br/>
You are the origin of all lives, I praise you,<br/>
yet you have no beginning, I praise you.<br/>
You are the end of all lives but have no end, I praise you.<br/>
You do not have the feelings of the five senses, I praise you. [74]<br/>
--------------<br/>
<strong>5.8. Ananthathu Azhuthal</strong><br/>
<br/>
71. O my father, I want to join you.<br/>
You made me yours and protect me.<br/>
When one considers what it means to join,<br/>
joining with you is truly joining—<br/>
other than joining your beloved ornamented feet,<br/>
there is no joining.<br/>
O lord, you are the pleasure of the goddess with beautiful eyes. [75]<br/>
<br/>
72. I do not want any pleasure in this world.<br/>
I do not want the pleasures of Indra,<br/>
I want only to worship your ornamented feet.<br/>
O lord, I want to shiver for your love,<br/>
worshiping you and folding my hands above my head.<br/>
My eyes should become a river and shed tears, O lord. [76]<br/>
<br/>
73. O lord I, a cheater, have no refuge but you.<br/>
I do not know how to say anything but lies.<br/>
I lie, yet you are my lord.<br/>
You share half of your body with your wife whose eyes are smeared with kohl.<br/>
I want to love you the same way as your true devotees and worship your feet. [77]<br/>
<br/>
74. I need the love of your ornamented feet.<br/>
I want rid myself of all the lies that I say and only tell the truth.<br/>
I am a dog.<br/>
O king, give me your grace and make me yours.<br/>
I want to praise you saying, “I praise you, I praise you!”<br/>
I want to worship you even if I die and am born again and again. [78]<br/>
<br/>
75. The earth and the sky bow to you.<br/>
All the four Vedas sing your praise<br/>
though they have not reached you—<br/>
they are frustrated, but they still continually sing your praise.<br/>
We did not leave you and worship you to receive your grace.<br/>
You share your body with your young wife who has round breasts.<br/>
What do you think? [79]<br/>
<br/>
76. My mind knows only to think of you,<br/>
but it is utterly unable to really know you.<br/>
I only hear your praise.<br/>
You are the whole world.<br/>
All my five senses have not known you or felt you.<br/>
How wonderful are your divine feet—where are they?<br/>
My only wish is to reach them. [80]<br/>
<br/>
77. O lord, when can I reach you?<br/>
I, wicked, have no refuge but you.<br/>
Knowing how I suffer, protect me<br/>
and show me your compassion.<br/>
I do not want anything from you<br/>
but your compassion. [81]<br/>
<br/>
78. O Esaa, there is nothing except you everywhere,<br/>
but people talk as if you were here or there.<br/>
I am innocent.<br/>
I say that you do not have favorites.<br/>
O my lord, faultless one, you made this wicked person yours.<br/>
You are a shining light,<br/>
and I do not think ever that there is any other god except you. [82]<br/>
<br/>
79. Ignorant, I have never attained you<br/>
by thought, deed, hearing, words or the lowly five senses.<br/>
I did not fall into fire like Nandanar,<br/>
my heart did not break into pieces,<br/>
I did not feel ashamed that I have not reached you.<br/>
I live longing to reach you, my father. [83]<br/>
<br/>
80. I, a cheater, have an iron heart<br/>
yet you made me yours.<br/>
You made me worship your feet<br/>
that are sweet as sugarcane juice,<br/>
but after I had tasted that juice, you left me.<br/>
There is fire and I have not fallen into it,<br/>
but you say that you love me.<br/>
What kind of trick is this? [84]<br/>
------------<br/>
<strong>5.9. Anantha Paravacam</strong><br/>
<br/>
81. You made me stay on this earth.<br/>
The devotees whom you love have reached your feet.<br/>
O lord, god of Thiruvaarur, I am afraid that I may be born again.<br/>
O Bhikshasana, what should I do? Tell me. [85]<br/>
<br/>
82. Your devotees accepted me as your devotee<br/>
and I wear divine ashes.<br/>
People on the earth scold me for being your devotee<br/>
but I want only to reach you.<br/>
I am your slave. [86]<br/>
<br/>
83. Am I not your slave<br/>
and have you not made me yours?<br/>
All your devotees have reached your feet,<br/>
but I cannot leave this evil body.<br/>
O lord of Sivalogam, I am a rough person<br/>
and do not know how to see you happily with my eyes. [87]<br/>
<br/>
84. I have not found the way to reach you.<br/>
I saw you before but I only spoke of you in vain and made myself low.<br/>
O lord, you are male, female and sweet nectar.<br/>
I am truly worthless, a shameless dog.<br/>
What is there for me to hold onto?<br/>
How can I come to you? [88]<br/>
<br/>
85. Doe-eyed Uma your wife is half your body.<br/>
O lord, you are the lord of the Vedas but the Vedas do not know you.<br/>
You are honey, nectar and hard for anyone to know.<br/>
O king, you forgive the faults of me, a small person.<br/>
I told you how hard it is for me to live in this world.<br/>
All your devotees have gone to Sivalogam,<br/>
but I and my lies could not go in and stood outside. [89]<br/>
<br/>
86. I and my lies stood outside of Shiva—<br/>
I have no true love for you.<br/>
Devotees who know no other thing than you<br/>
did service for you and followed you and reached your feet. [90]<br/>
<br/>
87. I am like a blind cow<br/>
that hears the sound of the village cows<br/>
and stands alone unable to follow them.<br/>
All your devotees are like those cows<br/>
and have entered your world and reached your compassionate feet.<br/>
I am your slave longing to reach your feet<br/>
and I cry for your love.<br/>
Give me your grace so I can reach your feet. [91]<br/>
<br/>
88. Devotees who loved you<br/>
melted like wax in their hearts,<br/>
reached your golden feet and worship you.<br/>
I am born uselessly and have not followed them.<br/>
I cry for your grace—have compassion on me. [92]<br/>
<br/>
89. You remove the sickness of those who worship you<br/>
and you make your beloved devotees worship your ornamented feet.<br/>
If you cannot make me worship your feet,<br/>
remove my karma and give me your cool feet quickly.<br/>
I am strong as bamboo.<br/>
You are the true lord who remove the false. [93]<br/>
<br/>
90. I am false, my heart is false, my love is false<br/>
and I have done bad karma.<br/>
If I cry for you, I will be able to reach you.<br/>
You are honey, nectar and sweet clear sugarcane juice.<br/>
You are a sweet deer.<br/>
Give me your grace and show me the path to reach you. [94]<br/>
<br/>
<strong>5.10. Anantha Athitham </strong><br/>
<br/>
91. You are a flood of compassion that never changes.<br/>
Your true devotees who came to you and worshipped your feet<br/>
received joy and stayed with you.<br/>
You, endless, made yourself simple<br/>
and came to the earth in a shining form.<br/>
I know this but my heart is still hard and does not come to you.<br/>
I am a low one, a dog<br/>
and it is sad that I have not became your devotee. [95]<br/>
<br/>
92. You share your body with your wife whose eyes<br/>
are adorned with kohl.<br/>
Even though you came to me and made me yours,<br/>
I thought of you as a golden dish in my hand
and did not realize that you are so rare, divine and hard to obtain.<br/>
You wear white ashes on your body so it shines.<br/>
Your true devotees reached you<br/>
but you made me always tell lies and left me on the earth.<br/>
Is it right that you left me here and went away? [96]<br/>
<br/>
93. I am not suitable to be your devotee.<br/>
I tell lies, and even when you called me to be your devotee,<br/>
I did not worry about it.<br/>
I am like a thief yet I have not tried to end my life.<br/>
O lord with lotus feet and a red body,<br/>
you gave your grace to your dear devotees<br/>
and took them to your abode but you kept me here.<br/>
Is this right, my lord! I have no hope.<br/>
I cannot be free from my karma. [97]<br/>
<br/>
94. I did not love your ornamented feet.<br/>
You share your body with your wife who has fragrant hair.<br/>
As if you were making a stone into a soft fruit,<br/>
you made me a devotee of your feet.<br/>
There is no limit to your compassion.<br/>
O lord, whatever I do, you have the power<br/>
to release me from my faults at once<br/>
and show me your ornamented feet,<br/>
O faultless lord of the sky. [98]<br/>
<br/>
95. Even the gods in the sky do not know you,<br/>
the Vedas could not find you,<br/>
people of every land cannot know you,<br/>
but you made me your devotee sweetly<br/>
and you made my body dance for you.<br/>
You made me melt in devotion for you and love you<br/>
and gave me wisdom to live in this world.<br/>
How can I be released from the desires of this world? [99]<br/>
<br/>
96. You created the world and the sky with no seed<br/>
and you protect and destroy them.<br/>
You made me, a cheater and low person,<br/>
stay at the entrance of your temple as if I were mad,<br/>
and you made me a friend of your good devotees.<br/>
Even if someone plants a poisonous tree, people will not destroy it.<br/>
I am like that tree, O lord. Save me! [100]<br/>
<br/>
97. You made me yours, I praise you.<br/>
I do have no other refuge but you, I praise you.<br/>
You are the highest of all the gods in the sky, I praise you.<br/>
I am a lower than all, I praise you.<br/>
You are my great compassion, I praise you.<br/>
You made me your devotee, I praise you.<br/>
O father, you are the beginning and the end, I praise you. [101]<br/>
<br/>
98. O father, you are my nectar.<br/>
You are my joy.<br/>
You are the honey that springs from my heart and melts it.<br/>
You made me your devotee.<br/>
You are faultless, adorned with a shining crown.<br/>
You are my help.<br/>
You keep your devotees in anxiety.<br/>
O lord, tell me, is it right to keep me in this world to suffer. [102]<br/>
<br/>
99. O king, my lord, you ask me to come to you.<br/>
You are the ancient god of Brahma, Thirumal and all other gods<br/>
and will be on the earth after all the things in the world are gone.<br/>
O lord who destroy the sins of your devotees,<br/>
you asked me to sing your praise with my tongue<br/>
and worship your ornamented feet. [103]<br/>
<br/>
100. I want to sing your praise, I praise you.<br/>
I want to dance, melt and melt in your devotion, I praise you.<br/>
I want to join your feet when you dance in the hall of Thillai, I praise you.<br/>
I want you to release me from this worm-like body, I praise you.<br/>
I should leave all my falseness, I praise you.<br/>
Give me moksha and your grace, I praise you.<br/>
You are the truth for your true devotees. [104]<br/>

<center><h3> 6. Neethal Vinnappam</h3></center>
 
1. O bull rider, you made me, a low person, yours with your compassion.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O lord adorned with jata, king of Utharakosamangai<br/>
who wear the skin of a strong tiger,<br/>
I am tired. Take care of me. [105]<br/>
<br/>
2. I am unable to leave the women<br/>
who have mouths red as kovvai fruits<br/>
and round breasts that touch each other.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
I have not done any good service for you,<br/>
O lord of Utharakosamangai.<br/>
Even though I am a thief, you made me yours—why? [106]<br/>
<br/>
3. My five senses are attracted to the dark eyes of women<br/>
as if I were a tree on the shore of a river undermined by its flow.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me,<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai.<br/>
You stay in flourishing Thiruvarur sharing your body with your wife<br/>
whose breasts are adorned with ornaments.<br/>
You nourish me. [107]
<br/>
4. You gave me your compassion and wanted me to praise you,<br/>
but I went away from you<br/>
and wished to live happily in this world.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O lord with hair adorned by the white crescent moon,<br/>
you are the king of Utharakosamangai with tall beautiful hills<br/>
and have a form of shining gold. [108]<br/>
<br/>
5. You are the king of Utharakosamangai<br/>
the bees drink honey<br/>
and swarm around the flowers that adorn your hair.<br/>
For a long time I was like a firefly that enters fire<br/>
and loved sweet-speaking women.<br/>
When you gave me your nectar-like grace I refused to drink it.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me. [109]<br/>
<br/>
6. You are my jewel.<br/>
I am ignorant and refuse to know your grace.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not hate me and leave me.<br/>
Remove my bad karma and make me part of you.<br/>
O god of Utharakosamangai,<br/>
don’t elders forgive the mistakes of small dogs like me? [110]<br/>

7. You are the truth,<br/>
yet you made me, a small one, important<br/>
and released me from my future births.<br/>
O dark-throated lord, king of Utharakosamangai,<br/>
lord Shiva with a red body,<br/>
release me from my troubles, do not leave me. [111]<br/>
<br/>
8. I ponder how I may be released from my karma<br/>
thinking, “Is it your grace?” and I sweat.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You are the king of Utharakosamangai<br/>
and ride on a garlanded bull that fights your enemies, terrifying them.<br/>
My five senses make my bad karma increase. [112]<br/>
<br/>
9. When you are separated from me,<br/>
I am like an ant with two heads<br/>
and want to achieve heaven and also enjoy the desires of this world.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You are the lord of all the three worlds,<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai<br/>
with a three-headed trident in your hand. [113]<br/>
<br/>
10. I worshiped your shining feet and made myself thin.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me,<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai<br/>
surrounded with blooming groves where bees sing the vilari raga.<br/>
you fought with your enemies with your strong bow<br/>
and burned their three forts. [114]<br/>
<br/>
11. My five senses go against my wishes<br/>
and do not allow me to reach your beautiful lotus feet.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
I have done bad karma<br/>
but you are the honey that springs in my heart<br/>
and you can release me from my karma,<br/>
O lord, king of Utharakosamangai,<br/>
great one, with a golden body that shines, adorned with divine ashes. [115]<br/>
<br/>
12. You came to me and wish to make me yours,<br/>
but I am involved with the desires of five senses and want to leave you.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai,<br/>
in your right hand is a victorious trident<br/>
that conquers your enemies and kills them.<br/>
I am cruel, but you are an ocean of nectar from which I can drink. [116]<br/>
<br/>
13. Like a dog that tries to drink up the water of an ocean,<br/>
I want to receive your compassion and be with you,<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai,<br/>
you stay in the bodies of your devotees who love you.<br/>
You are honey from flowers, a jewel, my nectar,<br/>
you are a flood of sweetness. [117]<br/>
<br/>
14. I am like a person caught in a flood,<br/>
I am thirsty but cannot drink water.<br/>
Even though I have received your grace, I still suffer.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You stay in the hearts of your devotees who love you,<br/>
O king of everlasting Utharakosamangi.<br/>
I am a thief. Give me your grace and a life of devotion. [118]<br/>
<br/>
15. Even though you made me join your ornamented feet with a happy mind,<br/>
I am still involved only in this worldly life.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai,<br/>
my father, compassionate lord,<br/>
your ornamented feet shine brighter than any light on earth.<br/>
You made me yours. [119]<br/>
<br/>
16. No one called me and said, “Dear one, don’t be afraid!”<br/>
I have been wandering and am tired.<br/>
You shine like lightning.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
Only you are equal to you.<br/>
O king of everlasting Utharakosamangai,<br/>
you are my mother and my father, O rare one! [120]<br/>
<br/>
17. O lord, you are everything in this world and above it.<br/>
I am lonely and you are my refuge.<br/>
You are a threat to any who defile your fame,<br/>
but you give your grace to your devotees,<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai<br/>
surrounded with beautiful groves.<br/>
You are darkness and light,<br/>
life on this earth and moksha.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me. [121]<br/>
<br/>
18. If I ask you, “Join me to you, make me yours or leave me,”<br/>
if you do not agree with what I say, will you leave me?<br/>
You drank the poison as if it were nectar to save the gods.<br/>
O king of everlasting Utharakosamangai.<br/>
you are the remedy for those who were born on this earth and suffer.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me. [122]<br/>
<br/>
19. The fire of your grace has destroyed the forest of my bad karma.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
Remove all my births and make me yours.<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai,<br/>
when you killed the cruel elephant to wear its skin<br/>
you frightened your wife who is beautiful as a creeper. [123]<br/>
<br/>
20. O beautiful lord,<br/>
I wander and suffer like a creeper that has no branch to support it.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You are in the highest place<br/>
where even the gods in the sky cannot reach you.<br/>
O king of everlasting Utharakosamangai,<br/>
you are the sky, earth, fire, wind and water. [124]<br/>
<br/>
21. My father, my five senses make me suffer<br/>
like a small piece of straw beneath fighting elephants.<br/>
I have done much bad karma.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O shining lord, you stay in my mind<br/>
as sweet as honey, milk, sugarcane juice and nectar<br/>
and you melt my flesh and bones. [125]<br/>
<br/>
22. O bright lord, you wear divine white ashes,<br/>
and shine with light.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You are close to your true devotees<br/>
but hard for others to know.<br/>
You are ancient, a female, male and ali. [126]<br/>
<br/>
23. I enjoy the pleasures of this world,<br/>
do many things that are wrong,<br/>
and love vain things. I am your slave—<br/>
release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
There is no one except you to help me.<br/>
I have suffered and now I understand<br/>
that you are the best thing in my life.<br/>
You are my only help.<br/>
Now I understand that you are my only help. [127]<br/>
<br/>
24. I do wrong things when there are many good things I could do.<br/>
I am not pure like a flourishing field.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me,<br/>
you who wear the skin of a long-trunked elephant.<br/>
My five senses make my body suffer<br/>
as if ants were swarming around a pot of ghee.<br/>
They do not allow me to come to you. [128]<br/>
<br/>
25. I suffer, caught in the enjoyments of five senses<br/>
as if I were a worm struggling as ants swarm over it.<br/>
I am alone and have no refuge.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You crushed cruel Yama with your lotus feet<br/>
and you gave the devotees who worshipped your feet<br/>
the highest position of the gods in the sky—<br/>
they will never leave your feet. [129]<br/>
<br/>
26. Separated from you I am like a small fish<br/>
that suffers in a large pond whose water has dried up.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
The white crescent moon in your jata<br/>
floats before the flooding water of the Ganges<br/>
like a small boat floating in the valley of a mountain.<br/>
You, a precious jewel adorned with jata, stay in the sky. [130]<br/>
<br/>
27. I fell into the breasts that were like ornamented hills<br/>
of women with shining teeth.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You made me who cry and shiver for you<br/>
join with your devotees.<br/>
O precious jewel, you showed me your divine feet. [131]<br/>
<br/>
28. My five senses confuse me so much that I walk on a false path. <br/>
Take me away from my wrong path and my sufferings. Don't leave me.<br/>
You drank the poison that came out of the milky ocean<br/>
as the people of the earth and the gods in the sky were frightened.<br/>
O lord, ocean of compassion, I, your slave, suffer.<br/>
You made me yours. You are the god of our family. [132]<br/>
<br/>
29. You made me leave my family and removed all my faults.<br/>
O victorious lord, you bent Himalaya mountain for your bow.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O father with a kondrai garland that shines like lightning,<br/>
your body is as beautiful as a lotus and no one can compare with you.<br/>
I suffer with the pain my five senses give me<br/>
as if they were a stick churning yogurt. [133]<br/>
<br/>
30. You wear a white garland.<br/>
Your head is adorned with buds on twigs<br/>
and you wear a long garland of skulls,<br/>
sandal paste with fragrant water<br/>
and a victorious vetchi garland.<br/>
My five senses hurt me like fire<br/>
and I suffer like cool yogurt churned by a churning stick.<br/>
I shiver—release me from my troubles, do not leave me. [134]<br/>
<br/>
31. You wear on your neck a snake,<br/>
and you are sky, wind, earth and fire.<br/>
O magic one, release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You are white, black and green with a red body,<br/>
you who conquered the strong elephant. [135]<br/>
<br/>
32. I am destroyed by my five senses<br/>
that are like strong elephants.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O shining precious jewel,<br/>
except for your devotees others cannot join you.<br/>
O lord, bright precious jewel with a dark throat,<br/>
you turned the fire-like poison<br/>
that came out of the ocean into nectar. [136]<br/>
<br/>
33. You are an ocean of compassion.<br/>
I did whatever I wanted and enjoyed life.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You are the king of everlasting Utharakosamangai,<br/>
the sweetness of branches, a jewel, nectar, a flood of honey. [137]<br/>
<br/>
34. I have not come leaving this happy world to join you<br/>
and to worship your ornamented feet.<br/>
O king of Utharakosamangai<br/>
ornamented with shining anklets brighter than many lamps,<br/>
you are easy to attain.<br/>
You made me yours, you are my father.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me. [138]<br/>
<br/>
35. You, the highest lord, even accept the faults I have done,<br/>
treating me like all your other dear devotees.<br/>
O lord Haran, release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
You wear in your jata the moon marked with a rabbit<br/>
and you wear a snake on your head.<br/>
My future births hurt me like a five-headed snake.<br/>
I have no refuge. I am afraid — save me. [139]<br/>
<br/>
36. O lord, the king of the sky, your jata swarms with bees<br/>
and is decorated with a beautiful garland of mandaram flowers<br/>
dripping with honey and spreading fragrance.<br/>
My five senses catch me and make me suffer<br/>
as if they were a smoking fire in a hole in a tree.<br/>
Do not leave me, save me. [140]<br/>
<br/>
37. O king, I am an innocent small person—<br/>
tell me not to be afraid of the mistakes that I have made.<br/>
Release me from my troubles, do not leave me.<br/>
O lord with fragrant jata, beloved of the goddess Lakshmi<br/>
who has white teeth, dark eyes and golden feet<br/>
and came out of the milky ocean rolling with waves,<br/>
my bad karma attacks me as if many mountains were crashing together. [141]<br/>
<br/>
38. I am separated from you<br/>
because my five senses made me so,<br/>
and I am unable to leave beautiful women who speak sweetly.<br/>
Do not leave me with them and save me.<br/>
O bright light, king of the burning ground,<br/>
nectar for your devotees,<br/>
it is hard to reach you and I am alone.<br/>
Remove my loneliness—you are my only help. [142]<br/>
<br/>
39. I ignored you, my only help,<br/>
and, leading a prideful my life, collected bad karma.<br/>
Remove my troubles and do not leave me,<br/>
O the companion of my heart.<br/>
I have done bad karma.<br/>
You are the only help for my life,<br/>
my treasure when I have nothing.<br/>
I cannot bear my troubles even if they are small,<br/>
but my body is a net of troubles. [143]<br/>
<br/>
40. I was caught by the glances of women,<br/>
was fascinated with them and wandered about.<br/>
Do not leave me, come to save me.<br/>
O lord, with beautiful jata ornamented with the white crescent moon,<br/>
ocean of compassion, king of Kailasa mountain,<br/>
beloved of the daughter of Himalayas,<br/>
you are the origin of my life. [144]<br/>
<br/>
41. I am caught by my desire for women<br/>
who have red mouths like crocodiles and I suffer.<br/>
Release me from my trouble.<br/>
I cannot bear my sick body that stinks.<br/>
O lord Shiva, I this right, is this right?<br/>
You share your body with your young wife<br/>
whose freckled breasts are ornamented with jewelry.<br/>
You are my refuge. [145]<br/>
<br/>
42. Even though, as a refuge,<br/>
you showed this slave your ornamented feet to worship,<br/>
I am not able to leave this body.<br/>
Do not leave me, O king.<br/>
The crescent moon in your hair was afraid of the snake,<br/>
plunged into the high water of Ganges and hid. [146]<br/>
<br/>
43. You are king and I am an ignorant little one.<br/>
You my joy—do not leave me.<br/>
You taught the true Vedas and cannot be described by words.<br/>
You appeared before your devotees who do not leave you.<br/>
O ancient lord, you are the future of all and of the world. [147]<br/>
<br/>
44. O lord, I melt like the butter in fire<br/>
with desire for women with sharp spear-like eyes.<br/>
Do not leave me.<br/>
Let me join your devotees in the sky<br/>
who worship your fragrant lotus feet.<br/>
I bow to you.
I have done many wrong things.<br/>
Do not leave me—you have made me yours<br/>
and I sing your praise. [148]<br/>
<br/>
45. I have not sung your praise or worshiped you.<br/>
You are my diamond<br/>
but you have not revealed yourself to me<br/>
and I have not left this body.<br/>
Do not leave me.<br/>
I am not surprised that I have not seen you.<br/>
I have not cried for you or run searching for you asking,<br/>
“Where is Shiva? Who has seen him?”<br/>
My body does not melt and I struggle to find you. [149]<br/>
<br/>
46. I am like a bee that longs for sweet jackfruit<br/>
as I desire the breasts of women with doe-like eyes.<br/>
Do not leave me.<br/>
If you do not help me, I will blame you and say,<br/>
“You with a throat dark as a cloud are not good, you are not smart.<br/>
Your jata is adorned with a waning crescent moon<br/>
yet you beg for food with a skeleton stuck to your hand.” [150]<br/>
<br/>
47. I saw your faultless devotees fall at your feet and worship you<br/>
and when I saw them I mocked them and stood there.<br/>
Do not leave me.<br/>
The Ganges flows with mandaram flowers,<br/>
white pearls and conches in your jata,<br/>
and the crescent moon floats on its water,<br/>
O lord adorned with a kondrai garland. [151]<br/>
<br/>
48. The Ganges flows in your jata<br/>
with the moon as its ornament and the stars its garlands.<br/>
Do not leave me. If you do, good devotees may ask,<br/>
“Who is this devotee?” I will answer them and say,<br/>
“I am a devotee of the beloved devotees of the king of Utharakosamangai,”<br/>
and they will all mock you.[152]<br/>
<br/>
49. If you do not forgive my faults, if you make me suffer,<br/>
I will tell people all my faults are only because of you, the Esan.<br/>
Do not leave me. If you leave me I will scold you and say,<br/>
“He is the lord who peeled off the skin of an elephant and wears it.<br/>
He is a crazy beggar who drank poison to save the gods.<br/>
He is a crazy dancer who dances in the burning ground.<br/>
He is crazy and he has made me his.” [153]<br/>
<br/>
50. Whether I scold you or praise you,<br/>
I worry that it is all my fault and suffer.<br/>
Do not leave me.<br/>
You who shine like a red coral mountain have made me yours<br/>
and give me, a small person, your compassion.<br/>
You drank poison that came out of the milky ocean.<br/>
I want to join you and drink that nectar. [154]<br/>

 7. Thiruvempavai</h3></center>

1. He is the wonderful light without beginning or end.<br/>
O my friend with eyes sharp as swords,<br/>
do you hear me singing the praise of the lord?<br/>
You are sleeping.<br/>
Are your ears closed so you cannot hear<br/>
people singing the praise of the great lord on the street?<br/>
You hear it, sigh and sigh and forget yourself,<br/>
roll on your bed, covered with flowers,<br/>
and you don’t get up or do anything.<br/>
What is this! What is this!<br/>
Do you sleep like this always? eeloor empaavaay. [155]<br/>
<br/>
2. You say all your love is for the lord, the highest light,<br/>
and speak of him night and day.<br/>
Do you love this bed covered with blossoms?<br/>
You and your friends are ornamented with lovely jewels!<br/>
Chi, chi, is this the way you play and mock the lord?<br/>
Even the gods in the sky feel shy to praise the lotus feet<br/>
of our bright lord, the god of heaven, and the giver of grace.<br/>
We are the beloved devotees of Isan,<br/>
the dancer in the golden hall in Thillai, aareloor empaavaay. [156]<br/>
<br/>
3. Her friends say,<br/>
“O young one, you smile beautifully with your pearl-like teeth.<br/>
When you get up early, your heart melts for the lord<br/>
and you say sweetly, ‘He is the lord, the joy, sweet as nectar!’<br/>
Come and open your door.”<br/>
The sleeping girl says, “O devotees of the lord,<br/>
you are the ancient servants of the lord and you are good.<br/>
I love the lord as you do. Won't you forgive my faults and accept me?”<br/>
Her friends say,<br/>
“Do you think we don’t know, you are pretending?<br/>
Do you think we don’t praise lord Shiva?<br/>
We really deserve this!” eel oor empavaay. [157]<br/>
<br/>
4. Your teeth shine like bright pearls<br/>
and you speak sweetly like a parrot.<br/>
We tell you everything we know about the lord.<br/>
Do not sleep and waste time.<br/>
The lord of the sky, the remedy for all,<br/>
the wonderful meaning of the Vedas,<br/>
is sweet to the eyes.<br/>
Without you, our hearts do not melt for him,<br/>
we cannot sing the praise of the lord<br/>
and do not know how to praise him.<br/>
Come and help us. Let us praise the lord.<br/>
Don’t sleep any more. Wake up, eeloor embaavaay. [158]<br/>
<br/>
5. O girl with fragrant hair,<br/>
come and open the door.<br/>
Your speech is as sweet as milk and honey! 
You lie and say that you know the mountain-like lord<br/>
even Thirumal and Brahma could not find.<br/>
This is just a joke!<br/>
Even though the world, the sky or anything else cannot know him,<br/>
he presents himself to us and gives us his grace.<br/>
We loudly sing his praise and his wonderful qualities and say, “Shiva, Shiva!”<br/>
but you do not wake up, you do not wake up,<br/>
parisiloor embaavaay. [159]<br/>
<br/>
6. O girl, lovely as a doe. I told you yesterday<br/>
that I would come and wake you up,<br/>
but you went away without telling me where you were going.<br/>
Aren't you ashamed? See, it is dawn.<br/>
The lord whom the sky, the earth and all other things do not know,<br/>
the king of you, of us and all others,<br/>
comes, gives us his grace and protects us.<br/>
We come singing the wonderful praise of the ornamented feet of the lord,<br/>
but you do not open your mouth,<br/>
you do not melt in your heart and worship him.
Sing his praise and worship him, eeloor embaavaay.. [160]<br/>
<br/>
7. O dear one, you say only a few words to praise him.<br/>
He, the most famous one, is not known by all the gods.<br/>
Open your mouth and say, “Shiva”<br/>
and we will tell his wonderful qualities to you.<br/>
Even before we say, “The lord of the south,”<br/>
you melt like wax in fire. Listen as we all say,<br/>
“He is our chief, our king and our sweet nectar.”<br/>
But you, as if you were hard-hearted, do not hear,<br/>
you just lie and sleep here and there without saying anything.<br/>
How could you sleep like this? parisiloor embaavaay. [161]<br/>
<br/>
8. The cock crows, the sparrows sing,
the sound of the white conches spreads beautifully everywhere.<br/>
We praise him saying,<br/>
“He is faultless light, he is pure and he shows us compassion.”<br/>
Don't you hear? May you prosper!<br/>
How can you sleep like this? Open your mouth.<br/>
Is this the way you love the lord of the oceans?<br/>
Sing the praise of the ancient lord of uzhi, the friend of the poor.<br/>
Sing his praise, eeloor embaavaay. [162]<br/>
<br/>
9. O lord, you are the ancient of the ancient,<br/>
the creator of past things<br/>
and of all things that will arise in future.<br/>
We, your devotees, have the fortune of having you as our lord.<br/>
We will bow to the feet of your devotees and be their dear friends.<br/>
We will do anything they ask us and make them happy.
O our king, if you give us this boon we will have no troubles,<br/>
eeloor embaavaay. [163]<br/>
<br/>
10. The lord is the meaning of all things.<br/>
Thirumal could not find his lotus feet<br/>
even though he went beneath the seven underworlds<br/>
and Brahma could not find his head<br/>
even though he flew to the top of the sky.<br/>
His divine body is not one, it is shared with his wife, innocent Shakti.<br/>
Even the gods in the sky, the Vedas, the earth,<br/>
his friend Sundarar, faultless kings and priests in the temples,<br/>
do not have enough words to praise him.<br/>
Where does he come from?<br/>
What is his name?<br/>
Who are his friends?<br/>
Who are his enemies?<br/>
How could we praise him?<br/>
parisiloor empaavaay. [164]<br/>
<br/>
11. O lord, we plunged into the large ponds swarmed with bees,<br/>
splashing with our hands again and again<br/>
and praising your ornamented feet.<br/>
O dear one, you are smeared with pure white ashes,<br/>
and you are the beloved of lovely Shakti<br/>
whose eyes are decorated with kohl.<br/>
We, your devotees for many generations,<br/>
have played as you wanted us to<br/>
and now we are tired. Protect us, eeloor empaavaay. [165]<br/>
<br/>
12. The dancer of the beautiful hall in Thillai<br/>
creates, protects and destroys all the worlds<br/>
and removes births that give suffering.<br/>
O girls, let us play, talk with each other<br/>
and plunge into the pond filled with blossoming flowers<br/>
as our bangles jingle and our anklets rattle<br/>
while bees swarm around our beautiful hair.<br/>
Let us praise his golden feet and bathe in the mountain spring,<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [166]<br/>
<br/>
13. The lovely kuvalai flowers bloom<br/>
and the red lotuses open their buds,<br/>
looking like our goddess and the lord joined together in love.<br/>
The kurugu birds sing and their sound spreads everywhere.<br/>
O devotees, come, let us bathe in the pond<br/>
filled with water where lotus buds bloom<br/>
and plunge and plunge into it.<br/>
As we bathe in the bubbling water<br/>
our conch bangles jingle and our breasts swing.<br/>
Let us plunge and bathe in the pond,<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [167]<br/>
<br/>
14. When we plunge into the water to bathe<br/>
our earrings swing, our golden ornaments sway,<br/>
and our hair decorated with garlands comes loose,<br/>
as the swarming bees sing around our hair.<br/>
Let us bathe in the cool water and praise Thillai,<br/>
Thiruchitrambalam, the hall where he dances.<br/>
Let us sing the Vedas and praise the lord of the Vedas,<br/>
the ancient, bright lord, without beginning or end,<br/>
adorned with kondrai garlands.<br/>
Let us praise the feet of our goddess ornamented with jingling bangles,<br/>
who gave us birth and raised us to be her devotees,<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [168]<br/>
<br/>
15. O girls, our friend says<br/>
as our lord raises his beautiful left foot and dances<br/>
his right leg stays firmly on the earth.<br/>
Her heart feels joy when she thinks of him,<br/>
her eyes shed unceasing tears,<br/>
she falls to the ground and worships him,<br/>
and she will not worship any other gods in the sky.<br/>
She is crazy only for the lord, our king.<br/>
We do not know how the skilled lord<br/>
could have made her love him so. Who is he?<br/>
O girls with bands and ornaments on your breasts,<br/>
let us plunge into the pond blooming with lovely flowers and play,<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [169]<br/>
<br/>
16. O cloud, you take the water from the ocean<br/>
and rise to the sky, looking like the goddess Uma,<br/>
shine with lightning like her small waist,<br/>
and sound like the golden anklets on her feet.<br/>
She, the goddess with eyebrows like bows, rules us<br/>
and she is never separated from her beloved Shiva.<br/>
O cloud, you pour like the sweet grace that she gives<br/>
to the devotees of our king Shiva, eeloor empaavaay. [170]<br/>
<br/>
17. O girl, bees swarm around your dark hair!<br/>
The lord gives us incomparable joy<br/>
that he does not give even to Thirumal, Brahma or other gods<br/>
and comes to our home and gives us his grace<br/>
so we may worship his lovely golden lotus feet.<br/>
Let us, his devotees, praise our lord, the lovely-eyed king, sweet as nectar,<br/>
so our lives may prosper.<br/>
Let us plunge into the bubbling water where lotuses bloom<br/>
and sing the praise of our lord.<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [171]<br/>
<br/>
18. When the gods in the sky<br/>
bow and worship the lotus feet of the lord of the Annamalai hills<br/>
as the jewels on their crowns lose their luster,<br/>
it is as when the sun, the eye of the world, rises,<br/>
and the dark clouds in the sky disappear<br/>
and the shining stars lose their brightness and hide.<br/>
He is precious as nectar, the bright sky, the earth,<br/>
all other things, a man, woman and ali.<br/>
O girls, let us sing and praise his ornamented feet<br/>
and plunge into the water and play,<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [172]<br/>
<br/>
19. “We give our child in the hands of the lord for he is our refuge”—<br/>
such is the saying, but we are afraid it may not be true.<br/>
O lord, we need to tell you something, listen!<br/>
May our breasts not embrace the arms of anyone but your devotees,<br/>
may our hands not serve anyone but you,<br/>
and may our eyes see nothing in the day or night but you.<br/>
O king, if you give us this boon here and now, why should we worry<br/>
about whether the beautiful sun rises or when it rises or where.<br/>
Let us plunge into the water and play,<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [173]<br/>
<br/>
20. Let us worship the ancient lord and his lotus feet<br/>
adorned with beautiful golden anklets<br/>
that give birth and joy and moksha to all creatures.<br/>
Let us praise his lotus feet and head<br/>
which Thirumal and Brahma could not find.<br/>
Let us worship his golden lotus feet<br/>
that give us grace and make us his.<br/>
Let us plunge into the water, bathe in the pond and play,<br/>
praising our lord in the month of Markazhi,<br/>
eeloor empaavaay. [174]<br/>

If the god of gods does not rule me and understand me,<br/>
who can help me to understand myself?<br/>

and gave me his grace.<br/>

17. I thought the wealth in the world is true<br/>
and as I plunged into it, I felt every day that I live is true.<br/>

praise him and dance the thellenam. [247]<br/>
<br/>
14. Even Thirumal, Brahma, the other gods<br/>
and the shastras cannot know him,<br/>
but he came to me, a small person,<br/>

<br/>

I will sing and praise the lord who never grows tired<br/>
so that my ego will be removed.<br/>
Let us dance the thellenam. [252]<br/>
<br/>

a treasure for Brahma and Thirumal,<br/>

<center><h3>12. Thiruchazal  </h3></center>

1. A girl:<br/>
He wears white ashes<br/>
and is ornamented with a snake,<br/>
yet he recites the Vedas with his divine mouth.<br/>
Is that not strange?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
What is wrong if he wears ashes,<br/>
and is ornamented with a snake?<br/>
He is the origin of all creatures. Sazhalo. [255]<br/>
<br/>
2. A girl:<br/>
He is our father,<br/>
our god, the lord for all, the Esan.<br/>
But why is his garment a small lion skin?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
The lion skin he wears<br/>
is the four divine Vedas<br/>
filled with profound meaning.<br/>
Can’t you see that, friend? Sazhalo [256]<br/>
<br/>
3. A girl:<br/>
His temple is the burning ground,<br/>
his garment is the skin of a murderous tiger<br/>
and he has no father or mother.<br/>
He is alone.<br/>
Do you see that friend?<br/>
Why is he like that? Sazhalo.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
He does not have a father or a mother<br/>
and he is alone,<br/>
but if he grows angry,<br/>
the whole world will fall into pieces of stone.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [257]<br/>
<br/>
4. A girl:<br/>
See, friend, he cursed Brahma, Kama, Yama and the moon<br/>
and wounded them all so badly<br/>
no one can recognize them.<br/>
Why did he do that, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
O friend with long hair,<br/>
if the three-eyed lord himself punished them<br/>
wasn’t that a victory for the gods in the sky?<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazalo. [258]<br/>
<br/>
5. A girl:<br/>
O friend, why did he cut off the heads<br/>
of Daksha and Echan<br/>
and destroy all the gods<br/>
who came to Daksha’s sacrifice?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
He did not truly destroy all the gods in the sky—<br/>
he gave them his grace,<br/>
and he gave a sheep’s head to Echan.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [259]<br/>
<br/>
6. A girl:<br/>
Brahma, god on the lotus,<br/>
and Thirumal were not able to find him<br/>
when he took the form of fire<br/>
and covered heaven and earth.<br/>
Why did he do that, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
If he had not taken a huge form<br/>
spanning the sky and the earth,<br/>
the gods would not have given up their pride<br/>
and could have thought they are higher than him.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo [260]<br/>
<br/>
7. A girl:<br/>
He gave half his body to the daughter of the Himalayas.<br/>
Seeing that, another girl, Ganga, became jealous<br/>
and took the form of the river that flows in his jata.<br/>
Why is this, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
If he did not have Ganga flowing in his jata,<br/>
all its water would fall on the earth and destroy it.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [261]<br/>
<br/>
8. A girl:<br/>
Why did he drink the terrible poison<br/>
that came from the roaring milky ocean?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
If he had not drunk the poison,<br/>
Brahma, Thirumal and all the other gods<br/>
would have not survived—<br/>
they would have seen moksha.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [262]<br/>
<br/>
9. A girl:<br/>
The lord, the dancer in the hall in Thillai,<br/>
lover of the southern land,<br/>
loved Uma and keeps her as half of his body.<br/>
Is he crazy to do such a thing, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
If he had not loved Uma,<br/>
the karma of the people of the world<br/>
would have made them crazy<br/>
and they would have done yoga for moksha<br/>
but not reached it.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [263]<br/>
<br/>
10. A girl:<br/>
He has no beginning or end.<br/>
Though I am like a dog I approached him<br/>
and he immersed me in a flood of joy.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
The gods could not find<br/>
the divine feet of the lord<br/>
that made you plunge into a flood of joy<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [264]<br/>
<br/>
11. A girl:<br/>
O young one, what kind of tapas does he do?<br/>
He loves to wear a garland of sinew and bones<br/>
and he carries a skeleton on his shoulders.<br/>
Why does he do this?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
I will tell you how he got his garland.<br/>
He wears the bones of Brahma and Thirumal<br/>
to show that at the end of the eon<br/>
their time is over.<br/>
Don't you see that friend? Sazhalo. [265]<br/>
<br/>
12. A girl:<br/>
He wears the skin of a forest tiger<br/>
and eats his food from a pot that is a skull.<br/>
Who would worship him and become his devotee?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
Whatever he wears, wherever he lives,<br/>
whatever he eats, it doesn't matter.<br/>
Brahma, Thirumal and the king of the gods Indra<br/>
are his devotees generation after generation.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [266]<br/>
<br/>
13. A girl:<br/>
O friend, before the sacrificial fire<br/>
our lord married the daughter of the king of the Himalayas,<br/>
beautiful as a golden doll or as Lakshmi,<br/>
with a forehead that glistens like a sword.<br/>
The whole world saw their wedding.<br/>
Why is it that, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
If he had not married her, the golden woman,<br/>
before the sacrificial fire,<br/>
the whole world would be confused<br/>
as to the meanings of all the arts and books.<br/>
Don't you see that, friend? Sazhalo. [267]<br/>
<br/>
14. A girl:<br/>
The dancer in the hall of Thillai<br/>
surrounded with flourishing fields flowing with honey<br/>
went to Thiruvalangadu and danced.<br/>
Why did he do that, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
If our lord had not gone there and danced,<br/>
the whole world would have become food for the goddess Kali<br/>
with a spear smeared with flesh.<br/>
Don't you see that friend? Sazhalo. [268]<br/>
<br/>
15. A girl:<br/>
O friend, even though there are strong elephants,<br/>
horses and chariots to ride,<br/>
the lord chose a bull as his vehicle and rides on it.<br/>
Let me know why he does that. Tell me friend.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
At the time when Lord Shiva burned<br/>
the three forts of his enemies,<br/>
Thirumal took the form of a bull<br/>
and carried the lord. That is the reason.<br/>
Don't you see, friend? Sazalo. [269]<br/>
<br/>
16. A girl:<br/>
Friend, why did the lord stay beneath the banyan tree<br/>
and teach the four sages<br/>
the inner meaning of the four Vedas?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
Even though he stayed in the shadow of the banyan tree<br/>
and taught dharma to the sages,<br/>
he also destroyed the three forts of his enemies.<br/>
Don't you see, friend? Sazalo. [270]<br/>
<br/>
17. A girl:<br/>
O friend, he, the dear lord, the dancer in Ambalam,<br/>
wanders about carrying a begging pot and begging for food,<br/>
yet all the people praise him and say he is god.<br/>
Why is that, friend?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
Did you ask me whether our friend is the god?<br/>
All the four Vedas do not understand that he is the great lord<br/>
yet they still praise him saying, “Esa!”<br/>
Don't you see, friend? Sazalo. [271]<br/>
<br/>
18. A girl:<br/>
O friend, why did the lord<br/>
who split open the body of Salandaran with his discus<br/>
give that weapon to the good god Thirumal?<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
The great god Thirumal took his eye<br/>
and placed it beneath the feet<br/>
of Shiva as a flower and did archana.<br/>
That is the reason.<br/>
Don't you see, friend? Sazalo. [272]<br/>
<br/>
19. A girl:<br/>
O friend, he wears a tiger skin<br/>
and drinks poison as his nectar.<br/>
What kind of trick is this?<br/>
I do not understand.<br/>
Explain it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
Whatever the lord wears<br/>
or whatever he drinks as nectar,<br/>
he does not consider his own greatness<br/>
but thinks only of his devotees.<br/>
Don't you see, friend? Sazalo. [273]<br/>
<br/>
20. A girl:<br/>
The lord stayed under a banyan tree<br/>
and taught the dharma<br/>
of the four Vedas to the sages<br/>
so that they could understand it.<br/>
Tell me about it.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend:<br/>
If he had not taught dharma<br/>
to the divine sages at that time,<br/>
they might not have realized the nature of the world.<br/>
Don't you see, friend? Sazalo. [274]<br/>

1. O lord, you made me yours.<br/>
Uma, your wife, is a part of you<br/>
and you both are with me, your slave.<br/>
Give me the grace to be with your devotees.<br/>
O dancer of the golden hall in Thillai, you are endless!<br/>
Come and fulfill my wish. [378]<br/>
<br/>
2. O lord, you stay with me and rule me and I follow your commands.<br/>
Even though I have done very little to reach you, I try to serve you.<br/>
Still I have not done enough tapas.<br/>
O lord, dancer in the golden hall in Thillai,<br/>
give me your grace and tell me how to reach you.<br/>
If you do not, won’t your devotees come to you and ask,<br/>
“Who is this one constantly worshiping you?” [379]<br/>
<br/>
3. O lord, my heart does not melt for you<br/>
and I do not feel much love for you,<br/>
yet you loved me your devotee and made me your slave.<br/>
If I complain to you and ask you to give me your grace<br/>
and you do not give it, won’t your devotees say,<br/>
“It is not fair of you not to give him your grace.”?<br/>
You accept the sacrifices that your dear devotees offer<br/>
and make them flourish.<br/>
If you do not present yourself to me, I will not live.<br/>
O dancer of the golden hall in Thillai,<br/>
you are everything in the world. [380]<br/>
<br/>
4. You are the origin of all the three gods, Thirumal, Brahma and Rudra,<br/>
the origin of me and my five senses and of everything in the world.<br/>
I cry and ask you to give me your grace<br/>
and I stay with your crowd of old devotees.<br/>
What can I do except ask you to give me your grace,<br/>
O king of the golden hall in Thillai? [381]<br/>
<br/>
5. O king, you are nectar,<br/>
the dancer in the golden hall in Thillai.<br/>
Searching for your grace<br/>
like a heron searching for food<br/>
I wait night and day and grow tired.<br/>
You do not give me your grace<br/>
as you give to your devotees and make them happy.<br/>
You are invisible, like ghee in milk, and you are silent.<br/>
Don’t you think the world will scold you for being like that? [382]<br/>
<br/>
6. The world may scold you and say<br/>
that I am your devotee while others may not worry about me.<br/>
I have not received your grace yet,<br/>
O lord, my father, dancer in the golden hall of Thillai.<br/>
I want to go to Thiruvolakkam and worship you.<br/>
Be compassionate to me and give me your grace to go there<br/>
where all your devotees crowd together to see you. [383]<br/>
<br/>
7. O lord, dancer in the golden hall of Thillai,<br/>
I wait thinking that I will receive your grace.<br/>
Will I be disappointed?<br/>
You make me imagine you and you rule me.<br/>
Will I be like wealth that has no one to protect it?<br/>
I want to come near you where you and your devotees<br/>
join together and play. You are my life.<br/>
Give me your grace and call to me, “Come!” [384]<br/>
<br/>
8. If you do not give me, your slave, your grace,<br/>
there is no one here to tell me, “Do not be afraid!”<br/>
You, precious as gold, came,<br/>
showed your concern and gave me your grace.<br/>
O dancer of the golden hall of Thillai,<br/>
separated from you I am worried and confused.<br/>
If you do not call me and make me one of your wise devotees,<br/>
I will die. If the world knew this, wouldn’t it laugh? [385]<br/>
<br/>
9. Some laugh, some are joyful,<br/>
some feel happy as if they tasted honey,<br/>
some join together and tell your greatness to others,<br/>
some hear it, some appreciate it, staying in various places,<br/>
and some worship you, recite your divine names and say,<br/>
“O lord, dancer of the golden hall of Thillai!”<br/>
How could I, low as a dog, stay among them?<br/>
Trust me and give me your grace. [386]<br/>
<br/>
10. I worship you and chatter your name, thinking,<br/>
“He will surely give me his grace.”<br/>
My eyes fill with tears, my mouth mumbles,<br/>
my mind thinks of you, worships you and melts.<br/>
I pray to you many times and say,<br/>
“You are the lord of the golden hall of Thillai!”<br/>
I am weak and tired. Have pity on me!<br/>
O lord, you rule me, and you have made me yours. [387]<br/>

1. O lord Shiva, the five senses, my enemies,<br/>
give me desires and confuse me.<br/>
You, my nectar, close the doors to those desires<br/>
and stay in my heart as a bright light.<br/>
I want to see you.<br/>
Come to me and give me your grace.<br/>
O lord Shiva, our joy and sweet honey,<br/>
god of Thirupperundurai, our love,<br/>
you abide across all the endless worlds. [388]<br/>
<br/>
2. O highest lord, you gave me your sweet grace<br/>
and my soul and body melt in love and joy for you.<br/>
O omnipresent lord, with no past or future,<br/>
you are the first one and you are endless.<br/>
O lord Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai in the southern land,<br/>
king of famous Shivapuram,<br/>
I have nothing to pay back your kindness. [389]<br/>
<br/>
3. O king, my father, you, the servant of your devotees,<br/>
entered my heart and melted it with devotion for you.<br/>
O true light, you removed my false darkness.<br/>
You, nectar, are a faultless ocean<br/>
whose waves do not break on their banks.<br/>
Words cannot describe you, for you can only be felt.<br/>
Let me know how I can describe you and feel you. [390]<br/>
<br/>
4. The sages who understand you become gods.<br/>
You are something beloved that can only be felt. 
O lord, matchless one, soul for all lives,<br/>
you are the remedy that removes births<br/>
and a pure light that appears in darkness.<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai,<br/>
unlike a person, you are joy that has no qualities.<br/>
Are there any troubles for those who approach you? [391]<br/>
<br/>
5. O faultless lord, sweet nectar, indestructible shining mountain,<br/>
the Vedas and the meaning of the Vedas!<br/>
You entered my mind and abide there.<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai,<br/>
you flow like water that has no bounds.<br/>
O lord, you entered my body<br/>
and now there is nothing more for me to ask. [392]<br/>
<br/>
6. If I beg and beg and melt for you<br/>
you rise as a bright light in my mind.<br/>
Your lotus feet touch the heads of the gods in the sky<br/>
when they bow to you.<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai,<br/>
you are the wide sky, water, earth, fire and wind<br/>
and yet you are none of them. O formless one,<br/>
I saw you with my eyes today and enjoyed you. [393]<br/>
<br/>
7. Like a rising sun, you entered my mind, stayed there,<br/>
removed my darkness and gave me your grace.<br/>
It is only you in my heart—nothing else is there.<br/>
I understand that there is nothing except you anywhere.<br/>
You are like an atom where all things join together as one thing.<br/>
You are not anything and without you there is nothing.<br/>
Who knows you? [394]<br/>
<br/>
8. O lord, you are the creator of all the worlds and the sky,<br/>
the spreading light, the fire in water,<br/>
faultless, understood by no one. Your grace, sweet as honey,<br/>
flows like a flood in the hearts of your devotees.<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai,<br/>
who is my relation in this world<br/>
and who is a stranger for me on this earth?<br/>
You are the only joy and bright light for me. [395]<br/>
<br/>
9. O lord, you are a bright light, formless and unique,<br/>
the ancient god who cannot be described.<br/>
You are a great ocean of joy<br/>
and you remove all the desires of the world for your devotees.<br/>
Endless, you are a mountain that gives your devotees faultless grace.<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thiruupperundurai,<br/>
where could you go without me?<br/>
Show me the way to go with you.<br/>
Come to me, give me your feet and your grace. [396]<br/>
<br/>
10. You gave me yourself<br/>
and you took me to yourself.<br/>
Tell me, who is the clever one?<br/>
I received endless joy by having you<br/>
but is there anything that you received from me?<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai,<br/>
you, my father and lord, have entered my body,<br/>
and I have nothing to give back. [397]<br/>
----------<br/>
<center><h3>23. Sethilappathu </h3></center>
 
1. I am a liar.<br/>
Even though I am separated from your ornamented lotus feet,<br/>
I have not died yet. Alas, I live in this world but I have not thought of you.<br/>
You are my lord and king, a large ocean of grace,<br/>
my chief whom Thirumal and Brahma could not find.<br/>
O lord with a red body,<br/>
I do not know what to do, O god of Thirupperundurai. [398]<br/>
<br/>
2. O king, the gods in the sky, the sages and others performed tapas<br/>
under trees and on the water where the wind blows.<br/>
They did not eat anything and suffered longing to see you.<br/>
Termite mounds covered their bodies,<br/>
but still they could not see your lotus feet.<br/>
You told me to become your devotee<br/>
and I gave myself to you, yet I do not suffer,<br/>
my heart does not melt,<br/>
and I do not give up this body that thinks of you.<br/>
I have not died and still wander about,<br/>
O Shiva of Thirupperundurai. [399]<br/>
<br/>
3. Even though I am a Pulaiyan,<br/>
you thought I am significant and gave me your grace.<br/>
I plunged into joy and walked on my hands.<br/>
O Sankara, rider of the bull,<br/>
even for all the countless gods in the sky, only you are permanent.<br/>
You, the omnipresent one, took poison from the milky ocean<br/>
and you burned the three forts of the Rakshasas with your bow.<br/>
Please make me die, O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai. [400]<br/>
<br/>
4.Brahma and Thirumal wished to see<br/>
your head and feet and melted like wax in fire—<br/>
still they wait to see you,<br/>
and many of your beloved devotees do hard tapas to see you,<br/>
becoming like skeletons and thinking only of you.<br/>
As they wait for you, why did you come and chose me as your devotee?<br/>
I am a rough person, with a mind like wood and iron<br/>
that does not think of you. My eyes and ears are harder than iron<br/>
and they do not want to see or hear you,<br/>
yet you gave me your grace and wanted me to be your devotee.<br/>
You abide in south Thirupparaaythurai,<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai. [401]<br/>
<br/>
5. O lord, you are beloved to all the gods in the sky<br/>
and they search for you.<br/>
I do not follow any other god except you and want your grace.<br/>
You are our lord.<br/>
Give me your grace so I will not be separated from you.<br/>
Show me your ankleted feet and remove my illusory body,<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai, lord of all the gods. [402]<br/>
<br/>
6. I have not cut my body like other devotees<br/>
and I have not entered fire and burned my body.<br/>
I do not know how to receive your divine grace<br/>
but I cannot be patient anymore.<br/>
I do not know how to be rid of this body.<br/>
Your devotees praise you, the bull-rider, saying, "potri, potri!”<br/>
I do not want to live without you. What should I do?<br/>
Give me your grace and tell me what I should do,<br/>
O lord Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai<br/>
surrounded with fields where water flows breaking its banks. [403]<br/>
<br/>
7. You are the magic one, the god of the sky<br/>
who drank the poison from the milky ocean<br/>
making your neck dark. You are our nectar.<br/>
I am a dog and I do not even think of you.<br/>
I am like a devil who does not worship your feet<br/>
saying, “Namasivaya,”<br/>
yet you show me the way to reach you.<br/>
The crescent moon floats in your matted hair.<br/>
Is it right that I stay far from you<br/>
and must cry out to reach you,<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai? [404]<br/>
<br/>
8. Brahma who lives on a lotus,<br/>
and Thirumal who lies on the roaring ocean,<br/>
and Indra and all the other gods are waiting to see you.<br/>
You have not showed me your love and your ornamented feet<br/>
and made me one of your devotees.<br/>
I am just waiting for you, wondering what could I do.<br/>
O lord, you are my remedy.<br/>
Is it right that I, your slave, must suffer to join you,<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai<br/>
surrounded with fields where cool water flows? [405]<br/>
<br/>
9. The people of the world, Indra, four-faced Brahma<br/>
and all the gods wait to see you,<br/>
but you gave me your grace and made me yours.<br/>
For Markandeyan, you kicked Yama and took his life,<br/>
yet you gave me those same ornamented feet to worship.<br/>
The Ganges flows on your head and you carry fire in your hand.<br/>
Even Thirumal cried and searched for you,<br/>
but, though my eyes are like wood,<br/>
you ordered me to come to your lotus feet,<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai surrounded with fields<br/>
where neelam flowers bloom and fish swim in the water. [406]<br/>
<br/>
10. You came to me, gave me your grace,<br/>
released me from my fears<br/>
and plunged me into the ocean of your grace,<br/>
yet I do not melt for you.<br/>
O Shiva, god of Thirupperundurai,<br/>
Thirumal with his conch and Brahma seated on a lotus<br/>
could not find you, the god of the sky.<br/>
You share your body with the daughter of Himalaya.<br/>
You are like an ocean and you stay in Kailasa mountain. [407]<br/>
---------------<br/>
<center><h3>24. Adaikkalap pathu  </h3></center>
 
1. Your dear devotees have attained your divine lotus feet.<br/>
I am a sinner without knowledge or wisdom.<br/>
My body is unclean and germs live in it,<br/>
and my mind is dirty, yet you made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave and you are my refuge. [408]<br/>
<br/>
2. O lord, you wear a snake around your waist<br/>
and the Ganges flows in your hair.<br/>
You forgive all my faults that others cannot abide because you are patient<br/>
and you destroy my future births with your divine grace.<br/>
I am your slave and you made me yours.<br/>
O lord, you are my refuge. [409]<br/>
<br/>
3. O clever lord, wonderful god, you remove my births<br/>
and, entering my mind, you make me crazy for you.<br/>
Brahma, seated on a lotus,<br/>
and Thirumal could not find your head and feet.<br/>
You give grace to all and have made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave, you are my refuge. [410]<br/>
<br/>
4. When your beloved devotees<br/>
were plunged into a flood of sorrows<br/>
they were saved by the boat of your ornamented feet,<br/>
and when I was plunged into the ocean of sorrows,<br/>
assailed by the fish of passion, you made me yours.<br/>
O, lord I am your slave, you are my refuge. [411]<br/>
<br/>
5. Caught by the tricks of women with curly hair, I forgot you.<br/>
I fell into this dark body and I am tired.<br/>
O lord of the gods in the sky,<br/>
you share your body with your beloved wife<br/>
whose doe-like eyes are adorned with kohl.<br/>
You made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave, you are my refuge. [412]<br/>
<br/>
6. I am consumed by the beauty<br/>
of women who have eyes like split mangoes decorated with kohl,<br/>
and my heart is broken and I suffer.<br/>
I am like yogurt that flows when it is churned in a pot.<br/>
Lord, may you prosper.<br/>
When will I reach your beautiful lotus feet and worship you?<br/>
I have done bad karma.<br/>
O father, ocean of compassion, you made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave, you are my refuge. [413]<br/>
<br/>
7. When I suffered, caught in the net of passion<br/>
of women with lightning eyes and small waists,<br/>
you, the sweet lord, came to me, gave me your grace<br/>
and released me from my passion.<br/>
You showed me compassion,<br/>
filled my eyes with tears like nectar<br/>
and forgave my faults.<br/>
O lovely-eyed lord, you made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave, you are my refuge. [414]<br/>
<br/>
8. You share your body with your wife<br/>
whose eyes are like cut mangoes.<br/>
Call me or make me join your feet—<br/>
I do not know your thoughts,<br/>
My heart suffers like the shuttle running<br/>
between the threads in a loom.
You made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave, you are my refuge. [415]<br/>
<br/>
9. Your devotees, never separated from you,<br/>
worship your feet and stay beneath them always,<br/>
and they receive the boon of not being born again.<br/>
I do not know the path of those devotees, I know only you,<br/>
yet I cannot really understand you.<br/>
You made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave, you are my refuge. [416]<br/>
<br/>
10. You gave the nectar of your grace to all your devotees<br/>
and I yearn to drink it also,<br/>
but it chokes me because I do not have the good karma to drink it.<br/>
Give me cool water sweet as honey and save me.<br/>
I suffer, but you have made me yours.<br/>
I am your slave, you are my refuge. [417]<br/>

1. Even Thirumal who carries an eagle banner<br/>
could not see your ornamented feet,<br/>
yet you, a faultless jewel, gave me your grace and your divine feet.<br/>
If only you would call me and give me your grace, saying,<br/>
“Leave the dark world and come to me!”<br/>
This is my desire—do you see that, my father? [418]<br/>
<br/>
2. I do not want to live in this body<br/>
that is like a pot with a brain and bones<br/>
covered with skin tied together with rope-like nerves.<br/>
O my king, my nectar, call me to come to you.<br/>
You are above all the creatures of the world and gods.<br/>
O father, I want to see you—do you see that? [419]<br/>

3. O king, dancer of the golden hall in Thillai,<br/>
release me from this body,<br/>
an ugly small hut swarming with bees,<br/>

hard for all the gods to know,<br/>
you protect all and give them your grace.<br/>
Please just glance at my face and pity me—<br/>
this is my strange desire.<br/>
Do you see that, O my father? [420]<br/>

The bones in my body are becoming thin<br/>
and my skin is swelling out.<br/>
My body suffers without ceasing.<br/>
I worship you, o lord.<br/>
I want to melt for you and see your bright light,<br/>

5. O lord, rider of the bull,<br/>
my body is covered with skin<br/>
but inside it has terrible wounds—<br/>
it is like a tamarind fruit covered with a rind.<br/>
O sweet nectar who wear divine ashes all over your body,<br/>
you came to me and made me yours.<br/>
I am a simple person and this is my desire. .<br/>
O my father, do you know that? [422]<br/>

6. I, a dog, was tired<br/>
and could not stay in this world anymore.<br/>
You made me live in a family<br/>
and you did not release me from it.<br/>
Even the gods in the sky<br/>
do not know your beautiful lotus feet.<br/>
O lord, you are my chief, you are my moksha.<br/>
I want to see your bright face and lovely smile.<br/>
O father, do you know that? [423]<br/>

7. O highest god, you are a bright light,<br/>

Come to earth, give moksha to all and make them yours.<br/>
In my desire for you, I say,<br/>

to wander and worship you, as sweet as nectar.”<br/>
O father, this is my wish. Do you know that? [424]<br/>

I want to embrace your beautiful ornamented feet<br/>
placing them on my head always,<br/>

melting like wax in fire. This is my desire.<br/>
O, king of Aiyaru, my father, do you know that? [425]<br/>

I want to see your bright light with my two eyes and feel joy.<br/>

I want to join the crowd of your old beloved devotees.<br/>
O father, this is my wish. Do you know that? [426]<br/>

10. I, a dog, was caught in the love nets<br/>
of fish-eyed women and suffered.<br/>
You, the light of knowledge,<br/>

who has feet soft as cotton.<br/>
I do not have any help.<br/>
I wish you would open your beautiful coral mouth<br/>

thinking that he is a treasure and a bright diamond.<br/>
I suffered for the pleasure of beautiful women<br/>
with breasts like vases, but he, my father,<br/>
made me made me join his devotees<br/>
and worship his divine matchless feet<br/>
that are more precious than jewels<br/>
and are as lovely as fresh lotuses<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [428]<br/>
<br/>
2. I have not thought of anything good.<br/>
I do not join with those who want to lead moral lives.<br/>
I was born in sorrow and die and wander in this world.<br/>
The highest lord, the omnipresent god<br/>
who shares his body with the goddess Uma<br/>
gave me his grace and made me one of his devotees.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [429]<br/>
<br/>
3. The lord, my father with an eye in his forehead,<br/>
is hard for anyone to understand<br/>
yet he took away my past karma and is easy for me to know.<br/>
He, my mother, with the crescent moon in his golden jata,<br/>
made me his and joined me with his devotees.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [430]<br/>
<br/>
4. People in this world call to me, saying, “He is crazy!”<br/>
There is a reason for this. Listen.<br/>
I did not know how to receive the divine grace of the lord and join with him.<br/>
I was about to fall and die in terrible hell,<br/>
but my lord came to me, made me his<br/>

Isn’t it a wonder! [431]<br/>

5. I did not join the devotees who praise him<br/>
or sprinkle flowers on him and worship him,<br/>
I only destroyed myself falling into the passion <br/>
of women with long hair decorated with kuravu flowers.<br/>
Lord Haran with shining jata who dances in the night carrying fire<br/>
made me his and joined me with his devotees.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [432]<br/>
<br/>
6. I am ignorant and have not thought of his divine name<br/>
or recited the five-letter mantra “Namasivaya.”<br/>
I was content to be born on this earth, die and become dust<br/>
without joining wise men or doing good karma,<br/>
but my god, my lord, gave me his grace, made me his<br/>
and joined me with his devotees.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [433]<br/>
<br/>
7. I believed that my body, made of flesh,<br/>
swarming with worms, rotten and unclean,<br/>
as if covered with a false roof, is real and suffered,<br/>
but my bright lord, precious as pearls, jewels, diamond and coral<br/>
made me his and joined me with his devotees.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [434]<br/>
<br/>
8. The lord removed my karma,<br/>
released me from my future births,<br/>
entered my body and taught me goodness,<br/>
made my body pure as a field that is plowed without a yoke,<br/>
and, shining like the rising sun, made me his<br/>
and joined me with his devotees.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [435]<br/>
<br/>
9. The life in this body is like the fragrance in a flower—<br/>
no one knows where it comes from,<br/>
and like that fragrance, we do not know where god is.<br/>
The lord took me, made me join his devotees<br/>
and kept me from follow the words of the crazy people<br/>
who enjoy whatever they may get in the world<br/>
and do not have in their minds the highest lord<br/>
who is without desire and pervades all.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [436]<br/>
<br/>
10. Without realizing that my body is a small dark hut<br/>
built by my bad karma,<br/>
I blithely thought it was something important<br/>
and was going to fall into hell.<br/>
The lord who angrily destroyed the three forts of his enemies with red fire<br/>
gave his grace to me, took me from my false path<br/>
and made me walk on his true path.<br/>
Isn’t it a wonder! [437]<br/>

<center><h3>27. Punarchip pathu—Joining the lord</h3></center>
 
1. O faultless jewel, when will I, a low person,<br/>
reach, worship, and happily join you,<br/>
a shining golden hill, a faultless pearl,<br/>
precious sweet nectar and a house of compassion<br/>
whom dark Thirumal and Brahma<br/>
have searched for and still cannot find. [438]<br/>
<br/>
2. O king, I am your slave and I cannot wait to join you.<br/>
When will the time come when I do not plunge<br/>
into the desires of my five senses on this earth<br/>
and praise you saying, “O Shiva, you are my lord!”?<br/>
When will my heart melt inside me,<br/>
becoming like water that springs from sand near a river?<br/>
When will I cry for you, worship you, and join with you,<br/>
O my faultless jewel? [439]<br/>
<br/>
3. I was not interested in worshiping the lord<br/>
who made tall Thirumal and Brahma afraid<br/>
when he took the towering form of fire,<br/>
but he, sweet nectar, made me his.<br/>
When will the time come when I can stand before his devotees,<br/>
cry, sprinkle fragrant flowers and join you, O faultless jewel? [440]<br/>
<br/>
4. When will the time come<br/>
when I can embrace and join the lord,<br/>
sweet as nellikkani, honey, milk, sweet nectar,<br/>
the taste of honey, and a bright light?<br/>
No one can describe him with words whose meanings they know.<br/>
Brahma seated on an alli blossom, Thirumal, all the other gods<br/>
and Indra the king of the gods praise and recite his names.<br/>
O lord, you are a faultless jewel. [441]<br/>
<br/>
5. Brahma took a form of an eagle and flew in the sky to find his head<br/>
and Thirumal took the form of a boar and dug up the earth to find his feet<br/>
but they could not find the lord,<br/>
yet he felt pity for me, accepted my service and made me his.<br/>
When will I praise his wonderful grace saying, “Ah, ah!”<br/>
and join him, my faultless jewel. [442]<br/>
<br/>
6. The lord, the highest joy, came to me with love<br/>
and gave his grace to me, his slave,<br/>
but I have not understood him and joined with him.<br/>
When will I escape this worldly life,<br/>
love him on this earth and be filled with joy<br/>
as my trembling eyes shed tears?<br/>
When will I join him, my faultless jewel? [443]<br/>
<br/>
7. When will I worship my matchless, unique lord,<br/>
a fire no one can approach, the ocean, wind, earth and sky,<br/>
crying till I choke as my eyes shed tears like a waterfall?<br/>
When will I fold my hands, sprinkle fragrant flowers on him,<br/>
and embrace and join him, my faultless jewel? [444]<br/>
<br/>
8. When will I join you as my heart melts and melts,<br/>
whether I stand, sit, lie, get up, laugh, cry, worship, praise, or dance?<br/>
When will I look at your shining divine body and shiver,<br/>
O lord, faultless jewel? [445]<br/>
<br/>
9. When will I praise you saying always,<br/>
“You are my father and you are the mother of all the seven worlds.<br/>
I am a dog yet you, the crazy one took me as yours.<br/>
You are the remedy to remove my births,<br/>
and you are my precious diamond.”?<br/>
When will I think of your beautiful feet night and day,<br/>
and join you with devotion sweet as dripping honey,<br/>
O lord, faultless jewel? [446]<br/>
<br/>
10. When will I join you, praise you and say,<br/>
“You are our protector, creator, destroyer,<br/>
the most ancient of all the gods in the sky,<br/>
the endless, the first one of the world, the seer and my highest god.”?<br/>
When will I sing and sing your praise, bow to you,<br/>
sprinkle flowers on your lotus feet and join you, O faultless jewel. [447]<br/>

you came to Thirukkazukkundram, appeared before me and saved me. [470]<br/>
<br/>
4. When I did not worship and love you every day<br/>
and plunged into the ocean of many bad deeds,<br/>

<center><h3>31. Kanda pattu </h3></center>
 
1. I was involved in the pleasures of my five senses,<br/>
wandering around all over,<br/>
destroying myself and I was going to fall into terrible hell.<br/>
The lord removed my bad thoughts,<br/>
made me Shivam, made me himself and gave me endless joy.<br/>
I saw him in beautiful Thillai. [475]<br/>
<br/>
2. When I was caught in the troubles of bad karma,<br/>
I did not think of the lord ever.<br/>
I became tired of myself and lived in this world.<br/>
The matchless lord made me himself<br/>
and removed my future births.<br/>
I saw the lord whom the whole world worships<br/>
in the dancing hall in Thillai [476]<br/>
<br/>
3. When I was in the womb of my mother,<br/>
the god of Thiruthurutthi came and stayed there,<br/>
formed all the parts of my body,<br/>
and with compassion he lovingly made me his.<br/>
I, a dog and his slave, saw him in beautiful Thillai. [477]<br/>
<br/>
4. The strong lord came to me<br/>
who am ignorant and lower than a dog,<br/>
made my life flourish and made me his.<br/>
He removed my desires for the world<br/>
and all people know that I am his devotee.<br/>
I saw the lord in the dancing hall of Thillai<br/>
where all people worship him. [478]<br/>
<br/>
5. When I, a dog, was caught and suffered in the whirlpool<br/>
of caste, family and birth, no one loved me,<br/>
but the lord removed all my troubles and made me his.<br/>

I saw the faultless nectar-like lord in happy Thillai. [479]<br/>
<br/>
6. I went to Thillai surrounded with thick gardens<br/>
and saw sages and gods going to the divine hall<br/>
to worship the dancing lord.<br/>
The ancient one, the ruler of the world<br/>
removes our future births,<br/>
releases us from sickness and old age<br/>
and takes away our desires for this world. [480]<br/>
<br/>
7. I have not done any good service or had devotion for the lord,<br/>
but he removed my desire for this world and gave his grace.<br/>
He made people think that I am crazy—<br/>

and made me join his divine feet.<br/>
I saw his tricky play in Thillai where he dances. [481]<br/>
<br/>
8. When I lived in this world uselessly with many ignorant thoughts<br/>
and did not know the results of my wrong deeds,<br/>
I saw the lord in Thillai<br/>
where faultless gods from the sky worship him.<br/>
He gave me endless joy and made me his. [482]<br/>
<br/>
9. I am a dog and do not know good behavior and manners.<br/>
The compassionate lord removed my bad karma,<br/>
brightened my heart and gave me endless love.<br/>
I saw the lord in the dancing hall in Thillai<br/>
where the Vedas are learned and recited. [483]<br/>
<br/>
10. The lord is the five elements—earth, fire, wind, water and sky—<br/>
the five sense organs—eye, ear, nose, mouth and body—<br/>
and seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching.<br/>
He, an emerald, a shining light<br/>
that destroys all the troubles of his devotees, made me his.<br/>
He is all differences yet he is not biased.<br/>
I saw him in famous Thillai<br/>
where the Vedas worship and praise him. [484]<br/>

but when I was separated from them,<br/>
I suffered and was troubled.<br/>
I want you to make me yours,<br/>
and I want to see the faultless joy and light of joining you.<br/>
I am tired. Give me your grace<br/>

2. Some of your devotees have received your grace,<br/>

Remove my bad karma and give me your grace<br/>
with your ocean-like compassion and make me yours.<br/>
I, your slave, long to melt for you. [486]<br/>
<br/>
3. As your devotees plunged into the large ocean<br/>
of your nectar-like grace, I lived in this world<br/>
with this dark body and I am tired.<br/>
See, my dear lord, those who see me here say<br/>
that I am confused and crazy and I frighten them.<br/>
Give me your grace and keep them from being afraid of me.<br/>
Make me yours and let me receive your true love. [487]<br/>

You are like the light of a lamp that never goes off.<br/>
I am your servant and I do not want anything<br/>
except your wonderful love. [488]<br/>
<br/>
5. You are the beloved of Uma<br/>
whose fish-shaped eyes are lovely as neelam blossoms.<br/>
I truly want to have your grace like your dear devotees.<br/>
I am a sinner.<br/>
Will I receive the ocean of highest joy through your grace<br/>
and be without the desire for my body and possessions in this world? [489]<br/>
<br/>
6. Your devotees receive your grace and go to moksha,<br/>
but I, a low dog, stay in this world babbling on,<br/>
wanting to receive your grace and melting in my heart endlessly.<br/>
I long for your true love and I want to think of you always.<br/>
I do not want to be separated from you.<br/>
You are a wonderful ocean<br/>
that gives endless happiness that I can never forget.<br/>
O lord, you make me yours. [490]<br/>
<br/>
7. All your devotees found joy in the ocean of happiness of your grace.<br/>
Is it fair that I, a low dog, stay in this world<br/>
where my troubles increase and I suffer?<br/>
Even though I knew you would give me your grace,<br/>
I did not ask you, O bright light.<br/>
Won't you give me your grace and remove my darkness?<br/>
O lord, you make me yours. [491]<br/>
<br/>
8. I want to join the devotees<br/>
who received your grace, their hearts melting with devotion.<br/>
My heart is hard as bamboo<br/>
and I have become weak saying, “Shiva!” always.<br/>
Give me the same love that your beloved devotees have for you,<br/>
and the grace that makes me continuously<br/>
worship your precious golden feet. [492]<br/>
<br/>
9. Your devotees are happy<br/>
that you gave them the grace they wished for.<br/>
I, your slave, am tired of living<br/>
like those who have not received your grace.<br/>
O lord of Shivalogam<br/>
you changed my mind with your divine grace and made me yours.<br/>
Give me the great joy of not being separated from you. [493]<br/>
<br/>
10. O sweet fruit who gave half of your body to your wife.<br/>
Do not make me suffer.<br/>
If I live like a suraikkaay without a hole,<br/>
is that a good thing for you to do to your devotee?<br/>
O king, my heart melts yearning to understand you.<br/>
When will you enter my heart and give your grace to this sinner?<br/>
I want to join you. [494]<br/>
<br/>
11. Your devotees join together, dance, laugh and are happy,<br/>
but I wither and do not know any way to reach you.<br/>
Should I stay here like a dried out tree?<br/>
Give me your grace.
I want to love you, join you and melt in my heart for you.<br/>
I want to dance, dance and be happy receiving your grace. [495]<br/>

O, beloved of Uma, you rule me and make me yours.<br/>
If I do something wrong, won't you forgive me?<br/>
O lord, with the crescent moon in your hair,<br/>

2. I am your slave.<br/>
I thought you had removed my troubles and ruled me.<br/>
O lord you share your body with your wife<br/>

Why have you not destroyed my body and taken me to moksha?<br/>
O lord of Kailasam, you made me yours.<br/>
Is it right not to call me and make me your servant<br/>

3. O lord, I am a dog and have no virtue,<br/>
yet you showed your compassion to me and saved me.<br/>
Where is that compassion today? Is it false?<br/>

5. You are all my senses, my tongue that praises you,<br/>
and my goal, my wonder, and the good and bad.<br/>
There is nothing in this world except you.<br/>
You are the truth, O god of Shivalogam,<br/>
When I am confused and truly praise you,<br/>
asking you to release me from illusion,<br/>
won't you come and help me? [500]<br/>
<br/>
6. You know what I want.<br/>
If I ask you for anything, you give it.<br/>
Thirumal and Brahma could not find you,<br/>
but you came to me and made me your servant.<br/>
Whatever you give is what I want.<br/>
If there is anything that I want,<br/>
it only the boon that you want to give. [501]<br/>
<br/>
7. You are a majestic mountain.<br/>
When you took me as yours,<br/>
that very day you made my body and all that I have yours.<br/>
How can I have any troubles now?<br/>
O father with eight arms and three eyes, you do only good for us.<br/>
If you make mistakes, am I going to be your target? [502]<br/>
<br/>
8. O lord with an eye on your forehead, I am lower than a dog,<br/>
yet you showed me your compassion and made me yours.
I want you to remove my illusory future births.<br/>
I do only what you wish—you can do anything in this world,<br/>
but only make me worship your ornamented feet. [503]<br/>
<br/>
9. O lord with an eye in your forehead,<br/>
my eyes rejoice seeing your feet<br/>
and I think only of them night and day.<br/>
I want to know how my body can leave the earth<br/>
and reach your ornamented feet.<br/>
O lord, I want to think only of your feet—<br/>
if I can do that, it is good to be your slave. [504]<br/>
<br/>
10. O beautiful lord, I am a low dog,<br/>
and I suffer wanting to see your beauty.<br/>
You showed me your divine shining body<br/>
and made me your servant.<br/>
O ancient lord, you are fame and you are the divine Vedas.<br/>
O ancient one, my king, you have not given me moksha,<br/>
yet you made me love you—is this right? [505]<br/>

1. You gave half of your form to Uma<br/>
whose waist is as thin as a snake.<br/>
You are never apart from my body.<br/>
O bull rider, destroyer of my karma,<br/>
you stay in famous Thirupperundurai<br/>
praised by poets with famous poems.<br/>
O sweet one, when will I go there,<br/>
see you and join you happily? [506]<br/>
<br/>
2. I am not fit to join the feet of the lord,<br/>
but as if placing a dog on a throne,<br/>
he entered my body and mixed with my life.<br/>
He will not be separated from my heart.<br/>
The lord with jata swarming with singing bees<br/>
stays in Thirupperundurai always.<br/>
He gave me a precious place<br/>
that even the gods in the sky have not received. [507]<br/>
<br/>
3. I do not know who am I or what is mine.<br/>
I do not know night from day.<br/>
He, the crazy lord who crossed beyond the minds and words of all,<br/>
has made me crazy.<br/>
The rider on a ferocious bull stays in Thirupperundurai.<br/>
I do not know what wrong I have done.<br/>
O lord, you are the highest light. [508]<br/>
<br/>
4. Is there anyone in this wide world<br/>
who can destroy our karma like him? Tell me.<br/>
He entered my heart and made me his.<br/>
He made me weak with devotion and joined me.<br/>
The great god of Thirupperundurai<br/>
stays in my heart, my eyes and in my words. [509]<br/>
<br/>
5. O people, because you have not destroyed<br/>
the desires of this world, you are destroying yourselves.<br/>
If anyone says, “True desire is holding to the lord,”<br/>
you will not listen to him.<br/>
Hurry and come to Thirupperundurai<br/>
where the lord with lovely jata stays<br/>
and join the devotees who worship the feet<br/>
of the destroyer of births. [510]<br/>
<br/>
6. He removed the karma<br/>
that comes to me like waves on the ocean,<br/>
entered my body and my life, and, staying there, filled them.<br/>
This is the mischief of my highest lord of Thirupperundurai<br/>
on whose crowned head the shining moon floats. [511]<br/>
<br/>
7. I do not want fame, I do not want wealth,<br/>
I do not want life on earth or in heaven,<br/>
I do not want birth and death.<br/>
I will not touch those who do not want to be devotees of the lord.<br/>
I worship the divine feet of the lord of Thirupperundurai.<br/>
and will not go away from him.<br/>
I will not allow him to be separated from me. [512]<br/>
<br/>
8. O lord, should I call you honey hanging from the branches<br/>
or should I call you the nectar in the sounding ocean.<br/>
I cannot wait to reach you, our lord, my king and my remedy.<br/>
You stay in Thirupperundurai surrounded with wet flourishing fields.<br/>
O faultless one, your divine body is smeared with sacred ash. [513]<br/>
<br/>
9. You are our god, our remedy and our nectar.<br/>
You, the god of Thirupperundurai,<br/>
have a body as beautiful as a vetchi flower.<br/>
I am you and you stay in my heart always.<br/>
I only know what I have now,<br/>
but I do not know what my future will be. [514]<br/>
<br/>
10. Your devotees of this world who went to heaven<br/>
performed tapas always and worshiped you,<br/>
but my body is a burden<br/>
and I stay in this world as if I were a forest tree.<br/>
You abide in everlasting Thirupperundurai<br/>
where kondrai trees bloom with flowers that drip honey.<br/>
If I become a sinner, won’t people say<br/>
that you do not give your grace to your devotees<br/>
and take care of them. [515]<br/>

holding fire in his hand<br/>

whom even the gods in the sky could not reach,<br/>
O my lord, I am afraid. [523]<br/>
<br/>
9. I am not afraid of thunder roaring in the sky,<br/>
I am not afraid being involved with kings,<br/>

who made me his and changed the poison from the milky ocean to nectar,<br/>
O my lord, I am afraid. [524]<br/>

I fall into passion for ornamented women.<br/>
O lord sharing half of your body with your wife,<br/>
give me your grace—I want to join your ornamented feet.<br/>
O father, who can know the path that you, the ancient lord, showed me? [657]<br/>
