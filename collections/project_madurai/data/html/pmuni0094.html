In the VAthavUrar purANam(V II) it is said that after the divine Master had returned to Kailacam, the sage with the 999 devotees remained under the Kurunthu tree at Perunn-turrai, where the God had first appeared to him; erected a shrine there, and spent this time in adoration and praise, until his fellow-worshippers passed through the fire to Civan, leaving him alone. To this, the first period of his religious history, the following three poems belong; and also according to tradition, lyrics 19, 20, 23-29, 32-34, 36, 38, 39, 41-48, and perhaps a few others.<br/>Here all the Tamil lines are of four feet, except the last, which has three only. The connection is VeNTaLai. The metre is veng-kalipA.<br/><br/><br/>SALUTATIONS<br/>Hail, the five letters!

The whole partakes of the nature of a rhapsody, - not without some sublimity, - and can be fully appreciated by those only who have studied the whole Caiva system as shown in Notes I-XVII.  It is an imitation, it would seem of the Sanskrit Catarudriya or Hyme to Rudra.  Yet, Civan - the Auspicious - is imagined by the Tamil Caivaites quite otherwise than by the northern and more ancient authorities Civan in the south is the Guru, the friend, ulmost the familiar companion, of His votaries, and is addressed with a mixture of awe and of simple affection that has a peculiar effect . Through all MAnikkaVacagar poems this personal relation of the God as manifested Guru to His devotees or disciples is, of course most prominent. I am not aware of anything quite like this in the mythology of the north though among the worshippers of Vishnu in His various incarnations something analogous may exist.<pr> Here lines 1-12 are very intricate, and emphasize two thoughts (1) that the Supreme in His greatness embraces all, and pervades the minutest things in His universe; and (2) that He is the unique Being, whose wondrous and admirable sublimity is not to be fully comprehended by any finite beings, gods or men.  The two epithets the the Great One (line 6), and the Beautiful one. (line 12). <p>The idea of lines 13-16 is peculiar to the Caiva system, which teaches that there are three great processes carried on by Civan, the Supreme, in the Universe. In the beginning of each aeon He evolves the phenomenal universe, and through countless ages sustains it as the theatre of births and deaths - of the whole drama of metampsychosis; and at the end of each aeon He  involves the phenomenal universe in its primal elements. These three processes of evolution,conservation and involution, are commonly assigned to three deities, of whom BrahmA is the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Civan the Destroyer.  This however was seen  to give to Civan an office apparently inferior, and certainly less gracious, than that which belongs to the other Gods.  The South-Indian Caiva system boldly faces this difficulty. According to it there is really but one God.  He is called, among many other names, Civan 'the Blessed One'. Vishnu and BrahmA and the other so-called gods are but dependent 'souls' like the rest, and at the beginning of each aeon their place and office for that aeon are assigned them by the Supreme as the result of merits accumulated.  The BrahmA of the present aeon is the Demiurge or fashioner of The evolved Universe:  he puts it into shape, and is the mere agent of Civan. This system invites us to contemplate the universe at the beginning of each aeon awaiting the action of the Supreme.  Existence is eternal; it is subject to what are called deluges, or overhelming catastrophes, in which all the heavens, and all the regions of the abyss, all worlds, and all beings are restored to their rudimental condition, after which, by the will and operation of Civan they resume their normal manifestations. What exists at the beginning of an aeon <p>First, we have the Lord, Pathi, Sivan, PerumAn.  He is the First Cause of all things; the only God.Inseparable from Himself, dwelling in Him,is His personified energy or Sakti --- his bride said to be the originator, source, fountain, beginning of all emotion, action, wisdom, and grace. <p>Secondly, we have Souls, lives, atomic existences,the flocks, pacu. These have now no embodiment , no powers, energies, or faculties,abiding like birds sleeping in the night on the branchces of some mighty tree, hardly to be distinguished from the tree itself, save that they live.   These are definite in number, and are eternal; no addition can ever be made to the number of souls that are alive in the universe, none of them can ever die.  Since, as we shall see, these may gain absolute identification with Civan-PerumAn and thus be embodied no more, the number of embodied souls diminishes; but no soul ceases to exist even after obtaining release, and being taken into God.  It may be, according to this system, that the time shall arrive when all embodied lives have obtained release, and then the worlds will for ever cease and Civan be all in all.  Each of these souls  has its load of deeds which are stored up, and are a' parte ante, eternal; the result of which, in pleasure or in pain, each soul in some embodied form must experience. As the Caiva system says, The fruit of deeds must be eaten '<p>     These souls, at the beginning of each aeon, crouch waiting for their embodiments.  There are now no evolved worldsno heaven, no hell, no gods and demons, men.  All these have been, and shall be,but now are not.  That SOULS may be furnished with embodiments, and with worlds in which they may experience their fate, we have  thirdly, the Bond, pAcam the eternal material cause of the creation. This is threefold, pure maya, impure maya and prakrithi, the of offspring of the latter, which is undefined. These three categories PATHI, PACU and PACAM - which we call roughly 'The God, SOUL AND MATTER' Are the subjects expounded in the Caiva Siddhantha Philosophy.<p><br/><b>Civan's palpable and subtle existence<br/></b><br/> The developement of the sphere of the elemental universe,<br/>Its immeasurable nature, and abundant phenomena,<br/>If one would tell their beauty in all its particulars,<br/>As when, more than a hundred millions in number spread abroad,<br/>The thronging atoms are seen in the ray that enters the house,  (5)<br/>So is He the GREAT ONE, Who exists in the minutest elements.<br/>If you would know Him, BrahmA and the rest with MAl,<br/>His greatness, source, glory, and end,<br/>Conjoined with His eternity, His extent, His abiding essence,<br/>His subtile ant palpable manifestations,                       (10)<br/>They sought to understand.

(65)<br/><br/>-------<br/>The Sea and the Cloud<br/><br/>Lines 66-95 are well nigh untranslateable, for they contain a subtle and intricate allegory, by means of which the grace of the manifested Civan, who is praised under the title of the 'Cloud' is set forth.  The idea is that the Infinite sea of rapturous supreme felicity is Civan, but - as the Cloud in the monsoon season sucks up water from the sea, and rises in black masses that cover the sky, while all the phenomena of the wonderful outburst of the beneficient, but also fearful, monsoon are exhibited - so does the Supreme manifest Himself as the Guru, the Object of Love, and Give of grace to His worshippers.  In the monsoon season, lightnings flash from one end of the sky to the other, crested torrents sweep down over the hills, bearing with them uprooted plants and trees, and not unseldom huge snakes that have been disturbed from their rocky mountain hiding places. The various kinds of 'Gloriosa' spread forth their beautiful flowers like supplicating hands, while every valley and hollow is filled with water. Meanwhile, as the heat is most intense just before the burst of the monsoon, the poet pictures a troop of thirsty antelopes, deluded by the mirage which seems to offer them refreshing streams and shade: disappointed they are left to die of thirst in the wilderness.  Meanwhile the pain of the fierce heat has ceased.  Down the gorges of the hill the torrent rushes, and is received into tanks prepared for it by the expectant husbandmen.  These lakes are fragrant with beautiful flowers, and on their banks the maidens have kindled fires with aromatic woods, at which they dry their hair and garments after the refreshing bath.  The cultivators may now sow their seed and expect a rich harvest.  All this is the work of the black clouds which drew water from the sea to fertilise the earth.  In these lines every particular of the description has its mystical meaning, which hardly needs illustration.  The student will compare VII, 61-64.<br/>----<br/> <br/>The ancient sea of bliss supreme is THAT indeed !<br/>Appearing like a black vast CLOUD,<br/>Arising in the hill of Petun-turrai blest,<br/>Whilst sacred lightnings flash frorn every point -,<br/>While serpent bright of sensual bondage dies -,                     (70)<br/>While the sore sorrow of the fervent heat hides itsellf;<br/>While the all-beauteous Hibiscus shines forth,<br/>Swelling in its wrath like our mortal pain,<br/>It sounds forth in mighty grace as a drum.<br/>While the kAnthal stretches out supplicating hands,                  (75)<br/>And the tender drops of sweet unfailing grace distil,<br/>While the gleaming torrent swells on every side,<br/>And rises to the highest banks of every lake -;<br/>The 'demon-car' of the six sects<br/>Excites the thirst of the large-eyed antelope throng.

These are divided into ten decades, and the whole are connected by the law which requires that the last word of each verse shall begin the following verse. The whole ten lyrics with their hundred verses are thus linked together.  This arrangement, which is very common in Tamil, is called AnthAthi, which I venture to translate 'anaphoretic verse'.  This cento is intended to exhibit the progress of the soul through the successful stages of religious experience till it loses itself in the rapture of complete union with the Supreme.  The general titile given by one editor is equivalent to 'The Varying Phases of Religious Enthusiasm' at least this is the nearest expression for it that I can find in English.  The poem is supposed to have been composed in Tiru-peran-turai immediately after the departure of the Saints, for some time MAnikka-VAcagar's companions, who passed through fire and went home to Civan. From the border of the tank, where the divine conflagration had arisen, into he midst of which his companions had thrown themselves, he returned to the Kondral tree, where he spent a long period in solitary meditation, of which these poems are the sum.  He surveys his past experiences, contemplates the work assigned him and while he begins the series of sacred poems by which he was to establish the Caiva system n the hearts of his fellow-countrymen, he never ceases to complain in most touching language, that he is not permitted at once to follow his Master and brethren into the rest and glory of Paradise.  This is indeed the burthen of much of his poetry.<p>     The titles of the ten decades, into which the poem is divided, indicate in some measure the course of his thoughts and the character of his mental conflicts.  There is a most pathetic alternation of rapturous and realising devotion with coldness and apathy, and even, it seems of temporary abandonment to gross sensuality.  It is to be doubted whether the whole of these verses are of one period, and I should prefer to think that they really embody his meditations and solloquies up to the period of his final settlement in Cithambaram.<br/><br/>DECAD 1.<br/><br/>THE COGNITION OF THE TRUE.<br/><br/>1.  Humble access to the New Master<p>My frame before Thy fragrant foot is quivering like al1 opening bud;-<br/>My hands above my head I raise; while tears pour down, my melting soul, <br/>The false renouncing,, praises Thee; with songs of triumph praises Thee,-<br/>Nor suffer I adoring hand to rest;-O Master, look on me !                (4)<br/><br/>II.  Self-surrender. He accepts the ascetic life.<p>I ask not bliss of Indra, MAl, or Ayan;-though my house and home<br/>Be ruin'd, friendship form I none save with Thine own; though hell's abys<br/>I enter, I unmurmuring go, if grace divine appoint my lot;-<br/>O King I no other god save Thee I ponder, our Transcendent Good !        (8) <br/><br/>III. He is despised as a mad enthusiast.<p>Transcendent Good ! Owner and Sire ! Thy servant melting thinks on Thee.<br/>In raptures meet I utter forth my fever'd soul's ecstatic joys,<br/>Still wandering from town to town; while men cry out, 'A madman this;'<br/>And each one speaks, with mind distraught, discordant words. O, when come  death ?                                               (12)<br/><br/>IV.  None to be worshipped but Civan<p>Erewhile was Dakshan's offering death. They ate the flesh, and poison feared<br/>' Our Father,' cried our friends and worshipt Him with suppliant voice.<br/>And yet  'Three are the gods that rule in heaven and earth,' they vainly deem.<br/>What sin is this your haughty minds breathe out, ye errirng penitents ?  (16)<br/><br/>V. I plead no merit- am no real devotee.<p>No penance have I done, nor bowed, with hand unstinting scatt'ring flowers;<br/>Born all in vain,-to ' cruel deeds ' a thrall,-the bliss of Civan's heav'n,<br/>Amongst Thy loving ones, I've fail'd to gain; see, and in grace bestow <br/>On me, Thy slave, consummate life beneath Thy feet, Supernal Lord !       (20)<br/><br/>VI.  Grace unfailing to the faithful<p>They roam'd and cull'd choice varied flowers to lay in worship at Thy feet,<br/>They deemed that all they sought they should obtain; and from these loving<br/>hearts<br/>In mystic guile Thou hidest still, abiding not ! In grace bestow,<br/>Love to Thy glorious foot, that I may ceaseless praise with perfect song !   (24)<br/><br/>VII.  Civan was an ascetic,as am I now. <p>Erewhile the Maker's-maker bowed, brought blooming flowers, and everywhere<br/>Sought for Th' All-seeing One, nor found. Our mighty One, Who dwells beyond,<br/>Here in the wilds with demons danced, a homeless, friendless one; and there<br/>In tiger-skin arrayed Himself, as madman wand'ring to and fro !         (28)<br/><br/>VIII.  Save Thy servants in the day of doom!<p>&gt;The wand'ring wind, the fire, the flood, the earth, the heaven,-a time shall be<br/>When these adown the gulf shall go ! After that hour unknown has come<br/>The deeds-mighty the soul to bind-Thy slave in wand'ring days has done<br/>Let the time come for these to pass ! Guard us from these, our Guardian then ! (32)<br/><br/>IX.  Bhavan's our Lord.<p>Bhavan's our Lord, Whose garland is the cool vast moon, of heavenly one<br/>The Prince. Civan's our Lord,Who made me His, my meanness though He saw<br/>Our Lord Supreme is He, and I, His lowly servant, thus declare !<br/>That earth may know, sound out that Bhuvan is our Lord !         (36)<br/><br/>X. 'Tis wondrous grace that sought me out.<br/><br/>Unmeet was I to enter 'mongst Thy loving ones, my flawless Gem !<br/>Ambrosia rare ! The way Thou took'st me for Thine own and mad'st me meet<br/>The very meanest lifting high, Thou didst the heav'nly ones bring low !<br/>What Thou our Lord to me hast done is as a play men laugh to see !      (40)<br/><br/><br/>DECAD  II<br/><br/>THE IMPARTATION OF DIVINE KNOWLEDGE.<br/><br/>XI.  A prayer for perfect love-<br/><br/>'Midmost of Thy devoted ones, like them in mystic dance to move;<br/>Within Thy home above to gain wish'd entrance, lo, I eager haste !<br/>O golden-glorious Hill of gems ! Give grace, that ceaseless love to Thee.<br/>Our Master, in my heart of hearts, melting my very soul, may 'bide.     (44)<br/><br/>XII.  Longing for grace alone.<br/><br/>I dread not any birth. To death what should I owe ! Nor do I crave<br/>Even heaven itself to gain. No power to rule this earth do I esteem.<br/>O Civan, crowned with cassia-flowers that sweets distil; our PerumAn !<br/>Our only Lord! I fainting cry: ' When comes the day I find Thy grace ?'    (48)<br/><br/>XIII.  Without Thy presence I pine<br/><br/>I ever pine Thy flow'ry feet to see, -Thy slave, dog though I am !<br/>I sit, no fitting flowers present, my tongue no rising raptures speaks.<br/>Thou Who the well-strung golden bow didst bend ! Ambrosia of Thy grace<br/>If Thou give not, I PINE,-a wretch forlorn,-what other can I be?     (52)<br/><br/>XIV.  Deadness of soul.<br/><br/>My inmost self PINES not, as were befitting, for Thy sacred Foot;<br/>Nor melts in love; I bring no wreath; speak out no worthy word of praise<br/>Within the shrine of Him, the King of gods, perform no service due;<br/>Nor move in dance. To death I haste ! Thou Whom true wisdom bringeth nigh!   (56)<br/><br/>XV.  God all in all <br/><br/>Thou art the Heaven; Thou art the Earth; Thou art the Wind;Thou art the Light!<br/>The Body Thou; the Soul art Thou; Existence, Non-existence Thou;<br/>Thou art the King; these puppets all Thou dost make move, dwelling within<br/>That each one says: ' Myself and mine. 'What shall I say? How render PRAISE (60)<br/><br/>XVI.  My praise is pure. Free me from embodiments.<br/><br/>The heavenly ones adore Thee still heaven's bliss to share ! Their minds to Thee<br/>They lowly humble that, on high exalted, men may worship them;<br/>Thou round whose flower-wreath hum the honey-bees ! Thy slave, I praise<br/>Thee, even I, that Thou may'st save from idle round of earthly birth !      (64)<br/><br/>XVII.  The bliss of Civan's heaven of presence. <br/><br/>The heavenly dwellers chaunt Thy praise; the fourfold VEdas utter song;<br/>She of the shining locks that shed perfume is sharer of Thy seat;<br/>There in true love Thy servants all commingling dwell; there, more and more,<br/>Thy feet with sounding anklets girt do they behold, Thou hard to know !(68)<br/><br/>XVIII.  This abandonment is unendurable.  <br/><br/>Thou Whom 'tis hard to know, in sky and in the golden court revealed,-<br/>Our mighty One ! beneath the jewelled feet where I was made Thine own,<br/>No more I scatter fragrant flowers, nor wondering weep, nor melt in love.<br/>'Tis past my power to bear ! How can it be ? I die, insooth, I die !      (72)<br/><br/>XIX.  He is above; we earthly still. <br/><br/>With flow'ry arrows in the spring-time comes the god of soft desire,<br/>And witching smile of maidens fair, with rosy mouths and flower-wreathed locks !<br/>Poor soul, that pants and melts through these, Who made thee His, and thrilled thy frame,<br/>To-day hath gone and dwells in heaven; yet see, thou still art lingering here !  (76)<br/><br/>XX.  O soul be wise!<br/><br/>O soul, that livest here in joy ! Of life's true joys bereft, in mire<br/>Thou sink'st of 'mighty deeds '! Him Who guards men from sinking praisest not !<br/>Thou art devising ruin to thyself,I tell thee so full oft;<br/>Thou'rt sinkcing even now beneath the FLOOD of the distressful sea! (80)<br/><br/>DECAD  III.<br/>DYING TO SENSE AND SELF.<br/><br/>This decad describes the mystic experience known by Caiva Siddhantha, as NAna-Carithai, in which the devotee, though able to discern God in and above and beyond all things, continues to perform outward rites (Carithai) and to avail himself ofall means of grace. See Civa-PragACam II.48.  Since Civan so deigns to manifest, and yet vell, His presence, the devotee is assiduous n performance of all prescribed acts of worship, while his soul transcends the visible, and by NAnam (in this connection = divine faith) sees God.<br/><br/>XXI.   I have relapsed into apathy.<br/><br/>Through Thine expanding locks the FLOOD pours down;<br/>   the Bull is Thine, Lord of the heavenly ones ! -<br/>They sang, and stood, with panting, melting souls,<br/>       like torrent, plunging in th' abyss ! and I,<br/>With yearning soul I heard ! Thou mad'st me Thine ! Yet now<br/>      from head to foot, I melt not;from my eyes<br/>The rushing waters pour not down;my heart<br/>          is stone;both eyes are wood to SINFUL me ! (84)<br/><br/>XXII.  Deadness has come over me.<br/><br/>Thou ent'ring stood'st by me fast bound IN SIN;<br/>          as one who says, ' I'm sin's destroyer, come !'<br/>Thyself announcing thus, Thou mad'st me Thine,-<br/>           becam'st my mighty Lord. Like iron statue, I<br/>Now sing no praise, nor dance, nor weep, nor wail,<br/>           nor faint with bliss. Behold, O Primal One,<br/>To Thee I make my plaint; nor know how this<br/>          with me shall end, Thou Who art First and Last !(88)<br/><br/>XXIII.  Very vile, but Thine, save me!<br/><br/>Thou'rt Ayan, Thou the fourfold VEdas' Lord;<br/>          I know Thee,-I, lowest of men that live;<br/>I know,-and see myself a very cur;-<br/>         yet Lord, I'll say I am Thy loving one !<br/>Though such I was, Thou took'st me for Thine own<br/>         Thy saints are here no longer, only I,<br/>Vile wretch ! and is it thus Thy greatness shines ?<br/>         Our PerumAn, what shall I say to Thee ? (92)<br/><br/>XXIV.  Thy votary, though full of sin.<br/><br/>And if I spake, ' Thou'rt ICan, Father, Sire<br/>          great PerumAn ;' thus have I ever said;<br/>If I besmear'd, 'twas sacred ash alone<br/>          I smear'd, still praising Thee, our PerumAn;<br/>Who erst made those Thine own who'd passed by love<br/>         o'er birth and death. In torrent plunged of lust<br/>And guile, behold me, spotless Hill of gems !<br/>          Father ! 'Twas such an one Thou mad'st Thine own !     (96)<br/><br/>XXV.  The mystery of His being.<br/><br/>Thy colour is not red,-nor white Thy form;-<br/>         Thou'rt Many, One; Atom, than Atom far<br/>Subtler; the heavenly host in 'wildered thought<br/>         know not the way, Father, to reach Thy feet.<br/>Thou showd'st Thy form, Thy beauty didst display<br/>        didst show Thy now'ry feet ! Me wandering, Thine<br/>Thou mad'st, safeguarding me from future ' birth ' !<br/>         Our PerumAn, what shall I say, what THINK ? (100)<br/><br/>XXVI.   Wonders of grace.<br/><br/>Thou mad'st my THOUGHT Thy THOUGHT ! Of me, mere cur,<br/>          Thou mad'st the eye rest on Thy foot's blest flower,<br/>Thou mad'st me bow before that flower alone ! My mouth<br/>         Thou mad'st to speak abroad Thy gem-like word !<br/>My senses five to fill Thou cam'st, and mad'st me Thine.<br/>         Ambrosial Sea of magic might ! O Mount ! Thyself<br/>Thou gav'st, Thy form like wild of roseate lotus flowers,<br/>        to LONELY helpless me. Thou Only-Light !          (104)<br/> <br/>XXVII.  The voyage<br/><br/>I, LONELY, tost by billows broad of anguish sore,<br/>           on the  great ' sea of birth,' with none to aid;<br/>Disturbed by winds of mouths roseate like ripened fruit,<br/>           lay caught in jaws of the sea monster lust !<br/>' Henceforth,what way to 'scape ? ' I frequent cried ! then thought,<br/>          and seiz'd the raft of Thy Five Letters ! So to me,<br/>O Primal One, Thou showd'st a boundless fertile shore,<br/>         and mad'st the rash insensate one Thine own ! (108)<br/><br/>XXVIII.  What He did for me.<br/><br/>Him none by hearing know; He knoweth no decay;<br/>           He hath no kin; naught asking, heareth all !<br/>While people of the land beheld, here on this earth<br/>           to me, a cur, He gave a royal seat;<br/>To me, a dog, all things not shown before, He showed;<br/>         all things not heard before, He caused to hear;<br/>And guarding me from future ' birth,' He made me His.<br/>         Such is the wondrous work our Lord hath wrought for me !      112<br/><br/>XXIX.   His appearing. <br/><br/>The WONDER this ! Say, is there aught like this ?<br/>         He made me servant of His loving saints;<br/>Dispell'd my fear, ambrosia pouring forth, He came,<br/>         and while my soul dissolv'd, in love made me His own;<br/>The Sire, Male, Female, Neither, Ether pure, was He;<br/>         as wondrous Fire; as End of all; beyond all far;<br/>His body like a flower of golden hue;<br/>         our Civa-PerumAn, our Lord, OF GODS THE KING !         (116)<br/><br/>XXX.  Triumph<br/><br/>The GOD OF GODS, to king of gods unknown;<br/>        King of the ' Three '; what teeming worlds create,<br/>Preserve, destroy; the First; Essence divine;<br/>         the Sire of sires; Fa,ther, whose half the Mother is;<br/>The King of all ! He came, and made me, too, His own.<br/>        Henceforth I'm no one's vassal; none I fear !<br/>We've reached the goal; with servants of His saints<br/>         in sea of bliss we evermore shall bathe !           (120)<br/><br/>DECAD IV<br/><br/>THE SOUL'S PURlFICATION.<br/><br/>XXXI.  The sluggish soul.<br/><br/>Thou dancest not; thou hast no love for the DANCER'S foot; <br/>       with melting thrill<br/>Thou singest not; thou throbbest not; thou bowest not down;<br/>         the flower of His foot<br/>Thou wearest not; thou crownest it not with flowers; there's none like Thee,<br/>         DEAD HEART !<br/>Thou seekest Him not through every street; thou wailest not; nothing know<br/>          I thou dost !                                (124)<br/><br/>XXXII.  The ungrateful, treacherous heart.<br/><br/>My Sire came, entered, made His own me who knew naught; in mercy taught<br/>        me all;<br/>Caused me to know the higher path; He loos'd my every bond !<br/>Despite the gain of changeless, sweetest gifts of grace,thou'rt changed, <br/>       DEAD HEART !<br/>RUINED by thee, to all that's false subjected, thus I RUINED lie !         128<br/><br/>XXXIII.  Heart unworthy of trust; insensible to complaint<br/><br/>My foolish senseless HEART, that changing, RUIN bringst to me,<br/>Henceforth I trust thee nevermore;-assuredly on Civan's mighty arm<br/>The ashes thickly smeared thou saw'st, yet melted'st  not; this, body's bonds<br/>Thou rendest not,-nor can I bid restore the ruin thou hast wrought.        (132)<br/><br/>XXXIV.  The utter folly of the fickle mind.<br/><br/>Perish, O restless mind ! before the Master Absolute,<br/>A dog I lay; Thou didst enjoy His fragrant flowery Foot;<br/>But now thou'rt severed like a young and tender shoot; all former bliss<br/>Hast lost ! Truly I deem Thy wisdom and Thy greatness measureless !       (136)<br/><br/>XXXV.  Insensible to infinite mercy.<br/><br/>When He to heavenly ones inscrutable, of acce~s easy to His saints,<br/>Our hidden sin destroyed, and made me His, thou knew'st the melting joy !<br/>Yet, HEART thou hast not, hating all thy hidden sin, prepar'd an ample field for Him,<br/>Nor bow'd before the Master's healing Feet, the heavenly goal to gain !    (140)<br/><br/>XXXVI.  What remedy?<br/><br/>If 'tis not given to pass the golden gate,-where all may entrance find,<br/>And whence none e'er departs;-nor yet to melt in love before the foot<br/>Of Him, my Sire, my Lord;-if there to me abound no more<br/>Ambrosia, every honied sweet;-a sinful man, what can I do for this ? (144)<br/><br/>XXXVII.  A sinner - I quit thee not.<br/><br/>What other sinners are there like to me, cur at the Master's Foot?<br/>Yet not a whit from me to sever is Thy sacred will; and thus,<br/>O Primal One, Thy Foot's fair flower if I should quit, arld yet live on,<br/>My soul is iron, stone my mind; my ear to what shall it compare !       (148)<br/> <br/>XXXVIII.  Life, a long exile.<br/><br/>The others all have reached the goal, yet I, who know not anything,<br/>Haste not to Thee who art all sweetness, Civan, King of Civa-world;<br/>Thou Spouse of her whose eye is like the tender fawn; long time<br/>I still abide, cherish this flesh, and so my death-in-life drags on ! (152)<br/>XXXIX.  How do I bear life?<br/><br/>O bliss that ceases not ! O bliss beyond compare ! His bright flower-foot<br/>He gave; to me of kind more base than dogs, He showed the perfect way<br/>My Chief, who gave me grace sweeter than mother's love, I see not now !<br/>Yet in the fire I fall not, wander not o'er hills, nor plunge me in the sea ! (156)<br/>XL.  Still the senses' slave.<br/><br/>'When Cupid's dart in springtide wounds, moonlight will scorch ;' of this I took!<br/>No heed; like milk 'neath churning stick I'm stirred by wiles of those of <br/>                fawn  like eyes.<br/>To Civan's city go I not, where grace as honey to the soul is given;<br/>To cherish soul within the body, still I eat, and garments still put on! (160)<br/>DECAD V<br/><br/>THE RENDERING A FIT RETURN<br/><br/>XLI.  I did not clearly apprehend Thine appearing.<br/><br/>Like elephant two-handed I saw not<br/>My mind's true germ; I saw but sore distress.<br/>Thou bad'st me, 'come'; yet, 'mid the heavenly ones<br/>'Twas l alone passed not, the senses' slave. (164)<br/><br/>XLII.  It must have been illusion. Is HE man?<br/><br/>To all who apprehend that one bright Essence truly is,<br/>As female, male, or lifeless thing Thou art not known;-<br/>To me Thy servant, coming as Thou art, Thou didst appear !<br/>I saw Thee, yet I saw Thee not ! What visual juggle this !(168)<br/><br/>XLIII.  When shall I really see Thee as Thou art?<br/><br/>Thou Form unique, to even heavenly ones<br/>Unknown ! Thou Mystic Dancer, Who didst make me Thine !<br/>Me Thine ! On earth, in heaven, or when all these<br/>Have passed away,-WHEN shall I see Thy face?  (172)<br/><br/>XLIV.  I am of earth, earthy.<br/><br/>Thou Infinite, by men yet seen !  Beyond eye's ken<br/>Thou Essence gleaming bright ! Here, like a fledgling, I<br/>Would gladly leave this faulty frame; yet know I not<br/>Dweller in this sense-world-how I may Thee put on.<br/>(176)<br/>XLV.  Deadness of soul.<br/><br/>I call not on Thee filled with mighty love,<br/>Nor render praise, nor fall in ecstasy<br/>'Tis with me as when death confronted Thee,<br/>Bowing before those lotus flowers Thy feet.     (180)<br/><br/>XLVI.  Call me, take me once more.<br/><br/>Call, take me 'midst Thy loving ones, Thou crowned<br/>With cassias, home of sweets and humming bees !-<br/>In 'midst, beneath, above, in all contained,<br/>Thou art, my Sire, ' like oil within the seed ! '(184)<br/><br/> XLVII.  The Self-sufficing sought out me.<br/><br/>Fathcr and Mother, Lord ! To all besides.<br/>Sire, Mother, Lord: to Him all these are not !<br/>Erewhile within my inmost soul He entered,<br/>Whom none by thought can know, the Ever-blissful One !  188<br/><br/>XLVIII.  I had but a glimpse of His glory.<br/><br/>To Thee, nor wealth, nor want ! From heavenly ones to worms,<br/>And grass, (no limit), all Thou fillest,  -Being rare !<br/>I saw Thy Foot-gem limitless, yet swerved from Thee.<br/>This is the grief I stony-hearted have endured !         (192)<br/><br/>XLIX.  An appeal.<br/><br/>My bonds Thou loosed'st, mad'st me Thine ! And all<br/>The loving saints who ashes gave beheld.<br/>Thou didst exalt, within the temple court,<br/>Ev'n me Thou didst exalt, who knew not anything.(196)<br/><br/>L.  I was not chosen for my wisdom or might.<br/><br/>Thou Only-Wise ! Ambrosia ! me, a servile cur,<br/>When Thou didst take and make Thine own, was I then wise ?<br/>Thou saw'st my ignorance that day Thou mad'st me Thine !<br/>Ah, Lord of grace, was I then wise ? was I then strong ?(200)<br/><br/>DECAD VI.<br/><br/>OVERFLOWINGS OF JOY.<br/><br/>LI. No possible return for such mercies.<br/><br/>O Master, O my Mighty One, my Father, PerumAn, my births'<br/>Destroyer, Thou Who mad'st me Thine,-an evil wholly worthless dog,<br/>And throughly base; I cannot think, Thou see'st,-of any meet return to Thee,<br/>O Shining One, Lord of the Porch,-nor know I aught that I can do.     (204)<br/><br/>LII.  I am still the senses' slave<br/><br/>Mean cur, that knew not what to do, I gave myself to gain those things<br/>That false ones gain, who ne'er have seen Thy flowery Feet of ruddy gold.<br/>I saw and heard that Thy true saints set free from lies, had gained Thy fragrant Foot;<br/>Yet I,-false one,-O Warrior strong !  still eat, am clothed, and here abide.  (208)<br/>LIII.  I only left !<br/><br/>Thou Warrior strong from out Thy golden city cam'st, mad'st darkness flee;<br/>With Her the beauteous Queen didst deign to come. The glorious devotees<br/>Who grace had gained, approached Thy Feet. I saw, yet like a sightless hog<br/>That roams the village street, shall I still roam a wretch doomed to live on ? (212)<br/>LIV.  My love is weak<br/><br/>Full many a saint through deathless time wrought penance,members mortified<br/>With frustrate hope to see Thee here ! Yet Thou didst sinful me Thy servant make.<br/>O Gem ! This frame with foulness filled wears not away. To see Thy face,<br/>The strong desire and love 'bide not in me; my Prince, how may I rise ?(216)<br/><br/>LV.  Still I live this loathed life.<br/><br/>Thy bride is Umai with the fawn-like eyes ! Thou cam'st and mad'st me Thine<br/>Ambrosia Thou, essential sweetness shed ! O Civan, southern Tillai's King<br/>Thy saints assembled 'neath Thy sacred sign have gone to gather round Thy feet<br/>This loathsome body still I guard, still here I dwell, O MASTER MINE !(220)<br/><br/>LVI . Thy will ordains my exile.<br/><br/>O MASTER MINE ! They think on Thee, Thy loving ones, with rapture filled<br/>They're Thine, Thy Foot I saw them join. Yet here more mean than village cur<br/>I dwell; my heart no rapture feels; my mind is stone, nor melts within.<br/>This body vile I still must guard and here abide,-such is THY WILL ! (224)<br/><br/>LVII.  My old life of earthly love.<br/><br/>The way THY WILL ordains befits me well ! Faithless I strayed, I left<br/>Thy saints. A reprobate was I I How did I watch the one belov'd,<br/>The quiverings of the lip, the folds of circling robe, the timid bashfull looks<br/>To read love's symptoms there ! My mind thus ruin to myself wrought out.   (228)<br/><br/>LVIII.  Was my vocation a mockery then?<br/><br/>Thou honied Sweetness, purest Joy, Souls' Light, Master Who fill'st with bliss<br/>The frame of those that trust in Thee, Giver of endless gifts ! Of worth.<br/>I void am yet Thy slave; Thou me hast made Thine own; if this be so<br/>Thy servant's state would show, I plead, Thy gift of grace was but Thy sport. (232)<br/>LIX.   What other refuge have I ?<br/><br/>Thy nature others know not ! Lord ! Me evil cur, lowest of all,<br/>Hast Thou not made Thine own ? And wilt Thou let me go cast out from Thee?<br/>Then who will deign to look on me ? What shall I do, O PerumAn ?<br/>Father, whose sacred form is gleam of gold, where shall I refuge find? (236) <br/><br/>LX.  I have sure hope; yet how unworthy!<br/><br/>I shall enter beneath Thy Foot which is mine ! 'mid saints that adore I standing<br/>Shall laugh, glad as I gaze on the well-known form! shameless dog tho' I am !<br/>No melting love is here! To see Thee - to be made Thine own, - can I<br/>Be meet ?

It consists of fifty quatrains, constructed in a beautiful metre  (see my Second Grammar 192) which is in fact epichoriambic (as is explained in the notes to the Tamil text).<br/><br/>     It is called AnthAthi poem.  This means that it is anaphoretic, the last word of a verse is to be repeated in the beginning of each following verse, and very often striking its keynote.  Hymn V is the same).  This has a beautiful effect in Tamil, but the difference of Idiom often forbids translator to attempt to reproduce it in English.<br/><br/>     The poem throughout is a genuine human cry for Divine help in the midst of a terrible struggle and is full of the most vivid emotion.  It was composed,  according to tradition, immediately after the wonderful cento that forms the fifth poem, and gives expression to the youthful devotee's feelings after his guru had finally departed, and the company of the 999 (?) saints who attended him had thrown themselves into the fire.  He is said to have gone round the Civan shrines in the PAndiyan Kingdom, and first of all to have spent some considerable time in the ancient city of Tiru-uttara-kOcamangai, which was at one time a PAndiyan capital, situate eight miles south-west of Ramnad, where the ruins of an important Civan shrine are yet to be seen.  There he suffered from the reaction  naturally consequent upon the excitement produced by the wonderful events of the preceding months.  He had been till now the petted, highly gifted favourite and prime minister of the PAndiyan Kingdom living in the midst of pomp and luxury, invested with almost absolute power; and was still in early manhood.  He finds himself at once a Caiva mendicant, who has renounced everything subsists on alms, and must spend his days and nights in solitary meditation.<br/><br/>     Meanwhile the circumstances in which he finds himself placed the lives of his companions, the whole environment of the temple, are not favourable to pure and high devotion.  The lofty ideal is not realized here.  Then, as now, the influences surrounding and emanating from the shrine itself were in many ways deteriorating.  From the evidence of these verses, we conclude that there were two things from which he suffered.  One of these was the allurements of the female attendants who, in bands pertained to the temple.  We have noticed this elsewhere. Hindu commentators will often find mystic meanings, which are harmless, - if unfounded. Again and again in this and other poems he deplores the way in which he has been led to violate his vow.  The other difficulty, often referred to was the way in which mere ceremonial acts had to be performed, affording no relief to his conscience. He thus fell into a desponding and well-nigh despairing state of mind, and sent forth this cry like that heard in the Psalter, and reiterated by the greatest Being that ever trod the pathway of this human life.  Few things in literature have such a genuine ring as some of the verses in which young noble bewails his apparent desertion by his Master.  Yet he never quite lost his confidence and love; and afterwards, as many of the lyrics show, exchanged for the 'spirit of heaviness the garment of praise'.<br/> <br/>    I do not think that any one can be found who will withhold his sympathy from the Sage. It may be noticed, though it is in connection with the Tamil text that the matter must be more fully discussed, that there is a great difference, as it seems to me, between the style of the first twenty stanzas (where indeed it may be conjectured that the poem originally ended) and those that follow. Notably in verses 21-50 there is only reference to Uttara-kOca-mangai, which city in verses 1-20 is a part of the perpetual refrain.  These latter verses, too, are more ingenious and subtle, and are more ful of poetic fancies.  Sometimes, indeed, they may seem to be even more beautiful than those that are the undoubted composition of the Sage.  Their language, rhythm, and manner seem to me, however, to be different.  But I readily acknowledge the difficulty that lies in the way of all merely subjective criticism, especially by a foreigner.  Yet the exceedingly uncritical way in which these texts have been hitherto handled necessitates and justifies the attempt.<br/><br/>     The writer did a great part of these translations at beautiful Lugano, not unfrequently relieving the toil by the enjoyment of an hour in the church of S. Maria degli Angoli, before the marvellous frescoes of Bernardino Luini; and could not help wishing oft times that the Tamil Sage and Seeker after God could have stood there, or haply knelt by his side.  Could Manikkavacagar have traced that history of the Great Master, of His passage from Gethsemane to the glory of His heavenly dwelling place, how would he have been affected?. One wonders!. It may be that he, and the weaver of MailApUr, and the  wandering sages of the NAladiyAr, and others whose legends we recall, have since, freed from the flesh, visited that spot.  Certainly they know those histories now! Shall we not in regard to our poet-sage, wherever his ashes are scattered, say hopefully and tenderly, Requiescat in pace?<br/><br/>Metre:  kaTTaLaikkaliththuRai<br/><br/>I.

It has always been attributed to Manikka-vACagar without any hesitation, though in many respects it is certainly unlike most of his other lyrics. It is said to have been composed for the use of the women at ArunACalam, among whom it is, and was, the custom to celebrate with great demonstrations of joy a festival in honour of the god Civan and the goddess Catti in the month of Margazhi, which corresponds to the second half of December and the first half of January. At that time the females of the city of all ages for ten successive days rise before dawn, and perambulate the precincts, arousing their companions from house to house, and proceeding to bathe (in rigidly decorous manner) in the sacred tank. There are passages in this poem which I have been obliged somewhat to veil, and modify, carefully preserving, however, the full and exact meaning of the original, as I conceive it. There is, however, connected with the Caiva worship, it must be said, a series of rites which is sometimes called the tantric, and sometimes the Cakti system. No doubt, in connection with this, many unspeakable abominations have been, and are at times perpetrated; and every thoughtful Hindu is sincerely anxious that all trace of these corruptions should be swept away. In all nations Similar things have existed, and it would be quite superfluous to enumerate the ancient rites of a similar character that have been enthusiastically celebrated. From such things the Caiva system must sever itself absolutely, which it can the more decidedly do, because they have no real root in the Caiva Siddhanta philosophy itself.<p>         In one edition of these poems there is the introduction to the 'Maidens' Reveille,' which gives a mystic interpretation to a large portion of the lyric. According to this author, from the month of Adi to the month of Margazhi (i.e. from July 15th to January 15th) is the night season; the other half of the year being the daytime;  the whole year forming a single day of the Gods. The former half of the year, in which there is rain with black clouds, is the representative of the secular period of involution  or destruction, when all things have been re-involved in the ripple veils of darkness, which period precedes that of the recreation, or evolution. The other half of the year represents the period of creation, i.e. the time during which the phenomenal universe is re-evolved from its eternal elements as the sphere of the activities of all things that have life. The month of Margazhi is then the symbol of the awaking of the universe from its slumber of involution. It is the dawn of the new creation,Ã of secular evolution. [NOTE XIII].<p>       Now this creation is the work of Catti, the manifested energy of Civan:Ãhis wife, who is the author, not of life indeed, but of the whole phenomenal system in which and by which life exerts its energy, and achieves its destinies. Civan himself can come into no personal relation with matter and its veiling delusions and darkness. It is, therefore, Catti that accomplishes the work; she is an energy of activity, of knowledge, and of desire; and through her alone the Supreme evolves all things. But this tantric system, like the gnostic systems of old, does not permit Catti as the Partner of the Supreme, to accomplish directly the work of evolution. This would be far too simple and direct for Hindu philosophy. There is a long chain of feminine manifestations (aeons evolved in succession, each coming into a relation to the Supreme that constitutes a distinct stage in the process; and it is only at last that BrahmA and Vishnu are evolved, to be respectively the fashioned and the maintainer of the cosmic world. The writer here enumerates nine of these Cattis amongst whom are numbered the chief female divinities that, under various names and epithets, are worshipped or propitiated in various parts of India. Among them is the dreaded KAli.  No doubt there are hints of all this in this poem, but its plain and obvious interpretation is the only one known to the majority of those that use it, and I imagine the composer himself was innocent of anything like the gnosticism and mysticism that his interpreters have given him credit for. As the hymn stands it is a beautiful composition, but in some parts it will seem to be somewhat obscure. I have tried to give a version that still be as literal as possible, but only the Tamil reader can feel how great a poet its author was; and only the student of the South-Indian Caiva philosophy can expect to enter into its spirit.<br/><br/>Metre: veNTanaiyAnvanta iyaRRavinaik koccackalippa<br/><br/><br/>I.

(60)<br/><br/>The word 'time' is Kal, so there is a play on the word Karai-kAl. It may be that the poet in another passage alludes to her beautiful prayer(XI, verse 8) <br/>'He gave me grace, tho' I all else forget, ne'er to forget<br/>His foot, whose mighty dance we sing!.'<p>----<p><b>The Mother of KaraikAl :</b><p> Some of the legends in the Tamil periya PurAnam relate to the period between  the first and second great revivals of Caivism, and a few are anterior to both. It seems pretty certain that, while the Jains and Buddhists were active and apparently triumphant everywhere, there were a great multitude of the faithful Caivites who, like the Covenanters in Scotland, were rendered more zealous by the persecutions to which they were exposed. Among these was the 'Mother' of KArai-kAl, who was a poetess, many of whose verses are still preserved. The legend gives a most interesting picture of some phases of South-Indian life a thousand years ago. The Mother 'was the wife of a rich merchant of KArai-kAl', whose name was, Paramadattan ('Endowed with heavenly gifts'). Her own name was PunithavathiyAr ('the pure'). She was very devout, and especially careful to entertain all Caiva devotees that came to her door. One day her husband received from some persons who had come to him on business a present of two mangoes, of a very superior kind, which he got home to his wife. Soon afterwards, a holy devotee arrived at the house as a mendicant guest but she had nothing ready to offer him except some boiled rice. This she set before him, and having no other condiment to present, gave him one of the aforesaid mangoes At noon her husband returned, and atter his meal ate the remaining mango, which pleased him so much that he said to his wife, 'There were two; bring me the other.' She went away in dismay; but remembering that the god to whose servant-because he was His servant she had given the fruit, never deserts those who serve Him, she offered a mental prayer, and straightaway found a mango in her hand, which she carried to her husband. Being A divine gift, it was of incomparable sweetness, and he said to her, 'Where did you obtain this?' She hesitated at first to reveal the wonder that had been wrought on her behalf, but reflected that she ought to have no concealments from her husband and so told him everything. He gave no credence to her words, but roughly replied, 'If that is so, get me another like it.' She went away, and said in her heart to the god, 'If thou givest me not one more fruit, my word will be disbelieved'.  Forthwith she formed another fruit still more lovely in her hand. When she carried this to her husband he took it in astonishment; but behold ! it forthwith vanished. Utterly confounded by these wonderful things, he came to the conclusion that his wife was a supernatural being, and resolved to separate at once from her. He revealed the matter, however, to no one, but quietly equipped a ship in which he embarked a great part of his wealth and then on a lucky day, worshipping the god of the sea, with sailon end a skillful captain, he act sail for another country, where he made merchandise, accumulated a fortune, and after some time re-embarking, came back to India to another city in the PAndiyan land, where he married a merchant'. daughter, and lived in great luxury. A daughter was born to him, to whom be gave the name of the wife with whom he had feared to remain, but for whom he retained exceeding reverence.<br/><br/>After awhile his return and prosperity became known to his friends In KArai-kAl, who resolved to compel him to receive again his first wife, their kinswoman, whom he had deserted. They  accordingly proceeded to his new residence, carrying with them in a litter his saintly spouse, the 'Mother' of KArai-kAl. When he heard that she had arrived and was halting in a grove outside the town, he was seized with a great dread, and proceeded with his second wife and daughter to where the 'Mother' was encamped surrounded by her kindred. He at once prostrated himself with profoundest reverence before her, saying, 'Your slave is happy here and prosperous thorough your benediction. To my daughter I have given your sacred name, and I constantly adore you as my tutelary goddess'.  Poor PunithayathiyAr, utterly confounded by this salutation and worship, took refuge among her kinsfolk, who all cried out, 'Why is the madman worshipping his own wife!'  To this Paramadattan replied, 'I myself beheld her work as miracle, and I know that she is no daughter of the human race, but a supernatural being, and so I have separated myself from her, and I worship her as my tutelary divinity, and have dedicated this my daughter to her, and therefore have  I worshipped her and call upon you to do the same.' But PunithavnthiyAr pondered the matter and prayed within herself to Civan the Supreme, saying: 'Lord, this is my husband's persuasion. Take from me then the beauty that I have hitherto cherished for his sake alone. Remove from this burthen of the flesh, and give to me the form and features of one of the demon hosts who evermore attend on Thee, and praise Thee.' That very instant, by the grace of the god, her flesh dried up, and she became a demoness, one of Civan's hosts, whom the earthly worth and heavenly world hold in reverence. Then the gods poured down a rain of flowers, heaveny minstrelsy resounded, and her relative fearing, paid her adoration and departed. So she had  now become a demoness, and her abode was the wild jungle of AlankAdu; but through the inspiration the god she sang several sacred poems, which are preserved. Afterwards there came upon her an irresistible desire to behold the Sacred Hill of KailACam, and with inconceivable speed she fled northwards till she arrived at the foot of the Mountain, and reflecting that it was not right with feet to tread the heavenly ascent, she threw herself down and measured the distance with her head. The goddess UmA, Civan's bride, beheld her thus ascending, and said to her spouse, 'Who is that in this strange fashion draws near, A gaunt fleshless skeleton, sustained only by the energy of love? To which Civan replied, 'She that cometh is the "Mother" devoted to my praises, this mighty demon-form she has obtained by her prayers.' When she drew near he addressed with words of love, calling her by the name of 'Mother,' which she for ever bears. As soon as heard the word she fell at his feet worshipping, and ejaculating 'Father !' Civan then said to her What boon dost thou ask of me?' She worshipped and replied, 'Loni, to me your slave give love which is undying, and infinite blessedness. I would fain be born on earth no more; but if I must so born, grant me at least that I may never, in any form, at any time, forget Thee, my God; when thou dost perform thy sacred mystic dance, beneath thy feet in rapture may I stand and sing thy praise', To which the God replied, 'In AlankAdu thou shall see my dance, and with rapture thou shalt sing.' Then the sacred 'Mother' of KArai-kAl returned, measuring the distance still on head to holy AlankAdu, where she beheld the God's sacred dance, and sang her renowned lyric his praise.<br/>---<br/>This legend illustrates a remarkable feature in the Caiva worship of the south, where devotees are not infrequently adored as having become demons. Doubtless, this is connected with pre-Aryan usages, and the poems attributed to the 'Mother' of Karaikaal present the most vivid picture demon worship with which I am acquainted. It is not difficult to imagine the source of tradition. We have the picture of a devout and enthusiastic worshipper of Civan, who sacrifices everything to the performance of her supposed duties to the god. She is misunderstood by inappreciative husband, who forsakes her, and finally, with scorn, repudiates her. She has herself a chapel in the jungle, where she spends her days and nights in prayers and austerities on her death is worshipped. The legends would soon accumulate, and the poems represent dramatic form the artistic view of all the circumstances.<br/>-----------<br/><br/><br/>XVI  The Cloud*, an Allegory<br/><br/>Erewhile thou didst the sea diminish, rising like the Queen; <br/>    didst glisten like Her slender waist Who rules my soul;<br/>Didst like the golden anklets sound that on Her sacred foot <br/>     in beauty gleam; didst bend like to Her sacred brow<br/>The bow.

OUR LADY FAIR, ARISE !      (64)<br/><br/>---<br/>* Here there is a subtle comparison between Civan, Catti, and a cloud that in the monsoon season rises from the sea.  The cloud drinks the waters of the sea, gleams in the sky with lightning fires, sends forth the voice of the thunder, is sometimes made beautiful with a rainbow, and then spreading itself over the heavens, pours down fertilizing showers on all the earth below. So Civan drank the poison of the sea; dances in Cithambaram while His golden anklets sound; wears a form of dazzling splendour; is renowned for the victories He gained with His bow; and pours forth blessings over all the earth. The comparison of UmA or Catti is obvious.

In some of them He relates his own experiences: In others he puts words into their mouths In the play the women, generally six in number, sit in a circle and toss a number of little balls from one to another with great dexterity and very swiftly. It is a pretty sight. They accompany their game a simple song, the rhythm of which is suited to the action of the players. In this case there are twenty verses of six lines, each verse having but a single rhythm. The subject of such verse .... generally some heroic exploits, such as are popular among all classes; or the great acts of a deity.  Here the title of 'rapturous joy' has been prefixed, as the editor seems to have conceived that as the  main idea of the verses.<br/><br/>I.  His advent as Guru. The Foot<br/><br/>Great MAl, the fiery-eyed, delved down, but failed to reach<br/>His foot's expanding flower! To earth that foot came down,<br/>Our birth' cut off, made those like us His own.-Lord of<br/>The south-landis clustering cocoa-groves, and Perun-turrai's shrine,<br/>And Tillai's sacred court,-a sage He came, call'd me in grace'<br/>And gave release. SING we His foot whence mercy flows ! AMMANAY, SEE !  (6)<br/><br/>----<br/>1-6. Here there are four lending ideas: <br/>1)  Civan rising as the mountain ArunAchalam passed above and below the roaring flight of BrahmA and the delvings of Vishnu;  2) this same Caiva graciously manifested Himself as a GURU to the humble, loving bard in order to release him from further metempsychosis;  <br/>3) He is also worshipped in the temple of Perun-turai, His great southern-shrine, where the saint first knew Him; and <br/>4)  in the sacred court of Tillai He dwells,  a BrAhman, one of the 3000 saints, the mystic Dancer and Dispenser of grace. There the sage is to obtain his consummation. <br/>These four ideas perpetually recur in these poems. This is un unfailing topic treated with inexhaustible variety.  <br/>--------<br/><br/>II.  Manifestations<br/><br/>To men on earth, to heavenly ones, to those beneath,<br/>To those beyond, He's scarce made known; to us accessible !<br/>The Name revered, the South-King, Perun-turrai's Lord<br/>Entering our souls, with frenzy filled them, showed the final way.<br/>Unsating Nectar, - in the billowy sea He cast His net;<br/>The Sea of full desire SING we ! AMMAANAY, SEE !              (12)<br/><p>--<br/>Civan cast His net, is a fisherman. This refers to a story in the fifty-seventh of the ÃSacred sports'. PArvathi was one day inattentive while Civan was expounding to her the VEdic mysteries, for which she was condemned by her angry husband and preceptor to be born on earth as a wife of a fisherman. Accordingly one day she was discovered lying as a tender infant under a Pinnai tree(or Punnai, Calophyllam Inophyllam)by the headman of the Paravar, a great clan of fisherman found everywhere along the coasts of the Tamil lands. By  him she was adopted, and grew up a maiden of surpassing beauty. At this time  Nandi the Chamberlain of Civan, in order to bring about the accomplishment  of the god's purpose with regard to the banished PArvathi, assumed the form  of a monstrous shark; and in various ways annoyed the poor fishermen, breaking  their nets and wrecking their boats. On this the headman of the paravars  issued a proclamation that whoever should catch the sea-monster should be  rewarded with the hand of his beautiful adopted daughter. Civan forthwith made  his appearance as a youth of noble aspect who had come from Madura, and at the  first throw of his net caught the shark and brought it to land. He accordingly,  having himself become a fisherman, received the fisherman's daughter in marriage.  The god now assumed his ancient form, and restored pArvathi to hers, and with  many gracious words took the foster father with Him to KailACham, the paradise  of Silver Hill.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>III.

Anthony of Padua, and some other mediaeval saints, had a great sympathy with the irrational creation. This poem is addressed to the humming bee, or winged beetles, which abound in all the topes and glads of South India, and are especially numerous in the shady groves that surround the temples;; having a great preference for the fragrant and beautiful trees which are sacred to the Hindu deities. The insect, here called Gottumbi, is probably the dragon-fly Ruplea Spenders. Here the SOUL is really addressed and exhorted to seek Civa's feet.<br/><br/>I.

(16)<br/><br/>------<br/>The Legend of Kannappa Nayanaar, or the 'Eye-Devotee'.<p> The image of this renowned South Indian devotee stands in the temple at KAlahasti (Calastri) near the Pulicat Hills. He was a rAja of UduppUr, and of the Shepherd caste ( a vEdan or Hill-men, perhaps a Kurumban). The story represents his ancient clan as possessing great wealth and authority in a wild hilly district, where their whole occupation was hunting.  There is a ZamindAr, who lives there now in feudal state.  The old chieftain, the father of Kannappan, whose name was NAgan (the Dragon-man) is represented to us as moving about attended by fierce hunting dogs, armed with every kind of rustic weapon; a skillful archer, around whose mountain-dwelling innumerable forest animals of every kind had their home, and  where the cries 'shoot' 'hurl' 'strike' were mingled from morning to night with the howlings of wild beasts, the barking of dogs, and the sound of the horns and drums of the hunters.  He had no son, and therefore he and his wife went to the temple of Subrahmanyan ( a son of Civan) - the favourite deity of mountaineers, and probably a pre-Aryan deity of the South, an object of worship, under many names and forms, in every Tamil hamlet.  To him they offered cocks and peafowl, made good feasts with copious libations of strong drink, performed wild dances; and in fact, according to the legend, seem to have worshipped much after the rude fashion of the demon worshippers of the present day.  The result was that by the favour of their tutelary deity a son was born to them, who from his early childhood shared in his father's pursuits, being brought up, it is expressly said, like a tiger's cub. The proud, happy father used to carry him about on his shoulder, but finding him one day too heavy to be thus borne, gave him the name of 'Tinnan' ('the sturdy man') which remained his pet household name.  He was erewhile to bear a more honourable and enduring title!  Soon after this the old chief, finding himself unable any longer to conduct the hunting expeditions of the tribe, made over his authority to his son, with whom alone this history is concerned.<p>      Henceforth our young hero is ever in the dense jungle with his veteran huntsmen.  One day a wild boar, of gigantic size, that had been caught in their nets, escaped and made off with prodigious speed to the mountain side.  Tinnan pursued it with two faithful attendants, but it let them a weary chase and did not stop till, exhausted with fatigue, it fell down in the shade of a tree on the slope of a distant hill.  There Tinnan with his sword cut it in two. His attendants came up and were astonished and delighted at his success and said, ' We will roast the boar here, and refresh ourselves'. But there was no water at hand, so they took up the carcase of the boar and carried it some distance onward, till they came to sight of the sacred hill of 'KAlahasti'.  <p>       At the view of the mountain one of the attendants cried out, that on that mountain summit there was an image of the 'God with flowing hair' (Civan). 'If we go thither we may worship him' added he.  Hearing this the young giant Tinnan again shouldered the boar and strode on, exclaiming, 'with every step that I advance towards the mountain the burden of the boar diminishes. There is some miraculous power here; I must find out what it is'.  So saying he rushed on with great eagerness till he came to the bank of a river, where he deposited his burden, bade his companions make a fire and prepare the feast, while he himself hastened onward till he beheld on the slope of the hill, on the further bank of the stream, a stone lingam, the upper part of which was fashioned into a rude image of the head of the god. The moment he beheld it, as the magnet draws the iron, it drew his soul, which had been somehow prepared by the merit of good deeds and austerities performed  in some former birth; and his whole nature was changed, every feelng being swallowed up the intense love for the god, whom for the first time he now beheld.  As a mother, seeing her long lost son return, tarries not, but rushes to embrace him, as he threw himself upon the image, tenderly embraced it, and fervently kissed it. With tears of rapture, his soul dissolving like was n the sunshine, he cried out, 'Ah, wondrous blessedness! to me a slave this divinity has been given!  But how is that the god remains here alone in a wilderness where lions, elephants, tigers, bears, and other wild beasts dwell, as though he were some rude mountaineer like me?'. <p>         Then, examining the image more closely, he saw that water had been recently poured upon it and green leaves strewn over it.  'Who can have done this?' said he. His attendant, who had in the meantime has come up, replied: 'In the olden time, when I came here on a hunting expedition with your father, a BrAhman, I remember came, poured water and placed leaves upon this image, repeating some mysterious words;- perhaps he is still here. So it dawned upon the mind of Tinnan that these and other services, which he himself could render, might be acceptable to the god. 'But,' said he, 'there is no one here to supply him with food. He is alone, and I cannot leave him  for an instant, yet I must perforce go and bring for him some of the boar's flesh cooked for our feast'. So, after much hesitation and unwillingness to lose sight for a moment of his new found treasure he went back, crossed the stream, where he found the food already prepared and his servants wondering at the delay in his return. Tinnan regarding them not, took some of the boar's flesh and cutting off the tenderest portions, roasted them on the point of an arrow; tasted them to ascertain that they were savoury; carefully selected the best, putting them into a cup of teak leaves which he had sewn together; and prepared to return to the woodland deity with his offering. <p>       The servants seeing all this, very reasonably concluded that their master had suddenly gone mad, and hastened off home to take the news, and to ask the priestess of their tribe to return with them and exorcise the evil spirit that they supposed had taken possession of their lord.  Tinnan unconscious of their departure, hastened back with the food in one hand, and his bow and arrow in the other.  As he crossed the river, he filled his mouth with water, with which coming before the image he besprinkled it.  He then took the wild jungle flowers from his own hair, and put them over it, and presented the coarse boar's flesh he had brought, saying: 'My Lord, I have chosen for thee the daintiest portions, have carefully prepared them with fire, have tasted them, and softened them with my own teeth.  I have sprinkled thee with water from the stream, and have put on thee flowers thou mayest love.  Accept my gifts!' [ This presentation of the food to the lingam and other images is often referred to in these stories, and the impression is given that the worshippers believed that the idol itself consumed the offering; but it is never expressly said that the food disappeared before the shrines, though this is sometimes implied.] Meanwhile the sun went down and during the whole night Tinnan with his arrow on the strung bow kept watch and ward around the god and at dawn went forth to the mountain to hunt, that he might provide for the daily wants of his new master.   <p>       While he was gone on this errand the BrAhman in charge of the lingam, who was a learned ascetic of renowned virtue and holiness, CivagOchariyAr, came at daybreak, and having performed his own ablutions in the river, provided himself with a vessel of pure water for the purification of the divine image, and a basket of sacred flowers and fresh leaves for its adornment and uttering the mystic  Five Syllables, devoutly drew near.  A scene of unutterable pollution met his horrified gaze.  Flesh and bones were strewed around, and the image itself had been defiled with filthy water and common wild flowers! With trembling horror he sprang aside, exclaiming, 'Oh, god of gods!what an unhallowed impious hands of mountaineers have brought these pollutions here.  How didst thou permit them thus to profane thy presence?'. So saying, he wept, fell down, and rolled in anguish before the god.  But, reflecting that at any rate it was wrong to delay any longer the sacred service,  he carefully removed the unhallowed things from the precincts, and proceeded to perform worship according to the Vedic rites: and having sung the appointed Hymn, and many times gone round the right image, and prostrated himself in adoration, departed to his hermitage.<p>         Meanwhile the servants, having taken the news of Tinnan's madness to old NAgan, his father returned with him and the priestess of their demon temple.  They both attempted to reason with the young enthusiast, and to recall him tot he worship to which he had been accustomed; but its wild  orgies delighted him no more.  His whole affection was centered upon the new found Civan so they  regarding him as hopelessly mad, returned sorrowing to their village.<p>   [One object of this legend seems to be the reconciliation of the orthodox Civa worship and the ruder forms of demon worship then in use.  The contrast is exceedingly striking when the refined and thoroughly instructed BrAhman, with his scrupulous attention to all the minutiae of vEdic worship, who regarded the slaying of animals as a crime, and the eating of their flesh as an unspeakable abomination, and considered that whatever had touched a man's mouth was  polluted and that the wild human inhabitants of the jungle were a lower order of creation is brought   face to face with the youthful chieftain of an almost savage tribe, whose chief delight is how to hunt down, slay and devour the birds and beasts of the forest; who brings boar's flesh for the unpolluted Civan to eat, and carries water in his mouth wherewith to besprinkle the image; who actually uses his leathern slippers to brush away the refuse leaves from the head of the god, who know no sacred texts; and who worships the same god, indeed, but has nothing to commend him save a rude uninstructed though zealous devotion.]<p>      Meanwhile the mountaineer guards the god by night, returns at  eventide to Offer his gifts and perform his rude service, and spends the day in providing flesh of beasts for the god's repast.At dawn, when the young woodman has departed, duly comes the pure and exclusive BrAhman having  scrupulously made his own ablutions, cleanses the precincts, and performs his ceremonious worship.  These men so different serve by turns before the same lingam, which they both regarded with equal reverence!      But this cannot long continue so.  The BrAhman makes a passionate appeal to Civan to guard himself from these pollutions, the author of which he cannot trace.  He then return to his hermitage sad and utterly perplexed.  But in the night the god appears to him, and then addressed him: ' That which thou dost complain of is to me most dear and acceptable! Thy rival ministrant is a chieftain of the rude foresters. He is absolutely ignorant of the VEdas and the Caiva texts. He knows not the ordinances of worship.  But regard not HIM, regard the spirit and motives of his acts. His rough and gigantic frame is instinct with love to me, his whole knowledge - in thine eyes craze ignorance - is summed up in the knowledge of Me! His every action is dear to me; the tougch of his leathern slipper is pleasant to me as that of the tender hand of my son Skanda.  The water with which he besprinkles me from his mouth is holy to me as the water of the Ganges. The food he offers me - to thee so abominable - is pure love.  I regard not the externals of worship.  He utterly loves me, even as thou dost; but come to-morrow when thou shalt see his worship, and I will give thee proof of his devotion to me'. <p>       The BrAhman slept no more that night, but at daybreak was put in hiding behind the lingam by the god himself. And now Civan, who knows the hearts of worshippers, in order that Tinnan's truth might be manifest, caused blood to trickle down from the right eye of the image. The young worshipper drawing near beheld this, and exclaimed : ' Oh, my master, who hath wounded thee? What sacrilegious hand, evading my watchfulness, has wrought this evil?' Then seizing his weapons he proceeded to scour the neighbourhood to see if any mountaineer or wild animal could be detected as author of the mischief.  Finding none, he threw himself on the ground in despair; but at length reflected that he had heard of remedies which would staunch the flow of blood.  So he went and sought out in the jungle some herbs of virtue, and applied them; but the wound bled all the more copiously.  Then a happy idea struck him; ' for a wounded eye the remedy is another eye applied,' said he; and pausing not an instant, with his arrow he scooped out his own right eye, and applied it to the bleeding eye of the image, from which at once the blood ceased to flow!  At this his rapture knew no bounds.  He sang and danced, and poured forth uncouth expressions of ardent thanksgiving; but on looking at the image once more, alas! blood was seen issuing from the other eye. After a moment or two of bewildered sorrow, his countenance was lit up with a radiant light of gladness; for he has still one eye left, and the efficacy of the remedy has been tried already; so he raises himself up, puts his one foot close up to the image's suffering eye, that he may be able to feel, when he no longer can see, where to apply the remedy;  and proceeded to scoop the other eye. But this last sacrifice is too much for Civan to permit to be consummated; from out the lingam he puts forth a sacred hand, and grasps that of the youthful enthusiast, who still holds the arrow ready to accomplish his pious intention, and says: 'Stay, Tinnan, stay thine hand, my loving son! Henceforth the place for ever shall be at my right hands, on my holy mount'. CivagOchari had learnt the lesson that LOVE AND SELF-DEVOTION AND MORE THAN CEREMONIAL PURITY, and fell prostate; while the choirs of heaven chanted the beatification of the Saint, who is from age to age adored while his title of Kann-appan - the devotee who gave his eyes for the service of his God.<br/>---<br/>V.
