<br/>
<strong> The Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam and the Thiruchokkanaathar Ulaa. <br/></strong>
<br/>
	The Thiruvilaiyaadal puraanam of the fourteenth century tells the sixty-three miracle stories of Shiva in Madurai. Through the stories the author tells us the genealogy of many Pandyan kings, the history of Madurai city and how it was constructed, many wars between the Chola and Pandyan kings, the three times when the deluge came, the establishment of the Sangam with forty nine poets in Madurai city and many other details. <br/><br/>
	The author of the Thiruvilaiyaadal puraanam is Paranjothi Munivar. He was born in the city of Thirumaraikkaadu in the Chola country. His father Meenakshisundara Desikar belonged to Vellala caste.  The author learned both Sanskrit and Tamil and became a scholar in both languages. When he grew up he went to Madurai to worship the god Sundareswarar and goddess Meenakshi.  Meenakshi appeared in his dream and asked him to write stories about the miracles of Lord Shiva and so he composed the Thriuvilaiyaadal Puraanam and read it in the assembly of Pandyan king. Scholars say that he lived in the 16th century CE. <br/><br/>
	Some scholars believe that the stories of Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam follow the Sanskrit “Haalaasyamaahaatmyam,” while others believe that Paranjothi Munivar’s work came first. The stories of Shiva in this book also occur elsewhere in Tamil literature in such works as  Cilappathikaaram, Kallaadam, Thevaaram, Thiruvaasagam and others. Other works  that describe the Thiruvilaiyaadals of Shiva are Perumpatrap Puliyur Nambi’s Thiruvaalavaay Udaiyaar Tiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam,  the Kadambavana PuraaNam, the Sundara Pandiyam and others. <br/><br/>
	Thiruchokkanaadar Ulaa: This Ulaa describes the greatness of Shiva and his escorts in procession in the first part. In the later part of this Ulaa the seven types of women who see Shiva in his procession tell us the same sixty-four stories that are told in Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam. The author describes the beauty of each of these women and their love of Shiva in this prabandam.<br/><br/>
	The purpose of this translation is to make available to the western world one of the finest prabhandams in Tamil. I will be happy if this translation is useful to those scholars who are working on later Tamil genres and religion. I should convey my sincere thanks to George Hart for going over the English. I would also like to thank my student Gita Pai who awakened my interest in the various Prabandams about Madurai city. I would also like to thank all my students who give me encouragement in all my efforts.<br/>

109. The flags that were raised hid the sky. <br/>
The glow of the rays of the sun <br/>
could not be seen because of <br/>
those raised flags<br/>
<br/>
110. The three-eyed Lord Shiva <br/>
came on the streets of Madurapuri <br/>
with his wife who is ancient <br/>
and eternally young. <br/>
<br/>
A group of women come to see the procession<br/>
<br/>
111. The young Kinnara girls, <br/>
the Apsara women <br/>
whose voices are sweet as parrots’<br/>
and young Gandharva girls <br/>
gathered in the sky <br/>
to see the procession.<br/>
<br/>
112. The women of the earth <br/>
who had reached heaven <br/>
crowded in the sky to see the Lord. <br/>
The women on earth all <br/>
came to see the procession.<br/>
<br/>
113. Numerous women beautiful <br/>
as lustrous valli creepers <br/>
stood and shone on the prosperous <br/>
small golden peaks of a high hill.<br/>
114. Some women stood on patios<br/>
where the bright moon shone in the night <br/>
looking like the dancing girls <br/>
of Indra’s world <br/>
who came out of the ocean of milk.<br/>
<br/>
115. Some women arrived <br/>
on magnificent chariots<br/>
as if they were strong valorous women <br/>
coming on a vehicle in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
16. They crowded the patios <br/>
on top of the palaces <br/>
looking like beautiful paintings <br/>
that came alive to see with love <br/>
the procession of the highest Lord.<br/>
<br/>
117. The women who gathered <br/>
on the wide streets praised <br/>
and worshipped lovingly <br/>
the feet of the Lord. They said, <br/>
<br/>
118. “The Lord grew angry with his wife <br/>
when she was born on the earth <br/>
with three breasts and fought with her.<br/>
Isn’t it a joke if our breasts <br/>
love to embrace his arms?<br/>
<br/>
119. “When his beloved wife attracted him<br/>
and loved him, he also loved her. <br/>
Won’t that kind Lord <br/>
show pity on us?<br/>
<br/>
120. “The saint Patanjali requested the Lord <br/>
to dance at his wedding <br/>
and the Lord did.<br/>
Does the Lord come <br/>
on this divine procession <br/>
only to see the love war of Kama?<br/>
<br/>
121. “The Lord appeased the thirst <br/>
and hunger of Gundodharan<br/>
at his wedding.<br/>
Isn’t it his duty to give us <br/>
his grace who fell in love with him? <br/>
122. “The Lord created a pile of food <br/>
to appease Gundodharan’s hunger <br/>
and made the Vaigai river flow<br/>
to quench his thirst.<br/>
Won’t that kind Lord take away <br/>
this suffering of love?” <br/>
<br/>
123. They praised the ancient <br/>
Lord’s divine smile. <br/>
Their hearts weakened <br/>
seeing the lustre of his lovely smile.<br/>
<br/>
124. They worshipped <br/>
his strong, handsome chest. <br/>
They did not feel shy <br/>
seeing the marks of<br/>
the breasts of Shakthi on his chest.<br/>
They said, <br/>
<br/>
125. “Does our clever Lord<br/>
need our clothes and beautiful bangles <br/>
to grow loose from the pain of love<br/>
to give his fragrant garland to us?<br/>
<br/>
126, 127. “Indra worshipped <br/>
the Lord of Thiruvaalavaay <br/>
with fragrant flowers, <br/>
nectar and the water of Ganges river. <br/>
Won’t our tears be the water for his bath?<br/>
Won’t the bangles of our hands <br/>
become garlands for his bed? <br/>
Won’t our hearts be nectar for him?”<br/>
<br/>
128. They went near him without fear.<br/>
They laughed impulsively.<br/>
They stood mesmerized.<br/>
They said, “The Lord who, like Kama,<br/>
kills us with love is coming.”<br/>
<br/>
129. They stood as if they were going <br/>
to say something but they could not.<br/>
They learned from their friends <br/>
what they should say <br/>
to the omnipresent Lord <br/>
but they forgot it.<br/>
They were confused and worried. <br/>
130. They said, “Do our ornaments <br/>
grow loose, <br/>
offerings for the husband <br/>
of wonderful Shakthi, <br/>
who shines like a diamond creeper.” <br/>
<br/>
131. They felt shy and <br/>
their clothes grew loose on their bodies.<br/>
They felt ashamed <br/>
when the flower arrows sent <br/>
from the sugarcane bow of Kama <br/>
covered their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
132. Different types of women stood there <br/>
to see the procession.<br/>
The pethai, a young girl <br/>
who wished to help Kama, <br/>
was among them.<br/>
<br/>
The Pethai<br/>
<br/>
133. The pethai was young as a Puvai bird <br/>
that had not learned Kama’s scripture.<br/>
She was a creeper <br/>
not yet grown and spreading.<br/>
She was a garland <br/>
not yet dripping with honey.<br/>
<br/>
134. She was a fragrant mango <br/>
that had not yet bloomed. <br/>
She was a diamond<br/>
that had not been worn.<br/>
She was a lovely baby cuckoo <br/>
that had not yet uttered its cry.<br/>
<br/>
135. She was a vanji creeper <br/>
that had not yet branched.<br/>
She was a lovely breeze<br/>
blown from the hills.<br/>
She was a fresh fragrant grove.<br/>
<br/>
136. She was a babbling parrot <br/>
that did not know <br/>
what was right to say <br/>
and what was right to do.<br/>
137. She was not yet grown <br/>
like the crescent moon.<br/>
She was a young swan <br/>
that does not yet know <br/>
how to separate milk from water.<br/>
<br/>
138, 139. Her breasts shone like <br/>
lustre of many suns <br/>
that will rise at the end of the earth.<br/>
Those small breasts <br/>
did not know their power<br/>
of destroying the sky <br/>
and the earth. <br/>
<br/>
140. 141.<br/>
The pethai’s hair was disheveled,<br/>
its strands loose and scattered<br/>
like the wandering senses of those <br/>
who lead false lives and are unable <br/>
to reach the lotus feet of the all-knowing God<br/>
who carries a bright axe<br/>
and rides on a strong bull.<br/>
<br/>
142. Her eyes did not yet know how to make trouble.<br/>
They were like the minds of those <br/>
who are released <br/>
from the illusions of the world <br/>
surrounded with oceans.<br/>
<br/>
143. Lord Shiva is God of gods.<br/>
He burned his enemies’ <br/>
three forts as they flew in the sky.<br/>
He is the king of Madurai <br/>
that is praised by scholars. <br/>
<br/>
144. The victorious Southern Pandya king<br/>
who wore fragrant garlands<br/>
gave abundant pearls <br/>
to people on the entrance of his palace.<br/>
The pethai went to that <br/>
lovely entrance with her friends.<br/>
<br/>
145. Bringing abundant, <br/>
matchless pearls <br/>
she went to the pandal decorated <br/>
with coral pillars on the street. <br/>
146. She built a small dollhouse <br/>
with many types of pearls. <br/>
She cooked rice with pearls <br/>
without knowing how to cook at all.<br/>
<br/>
147. She fed her parrot, mothers, friends <br/>
and the baby doll in her hands. <br/>
Such was her sweet nature.<br/>
<br/>
148. She taught words to her Puvai bird, <br/>
the most marvelous among birds,<br/>
pretending that she instead was learning <br/>
words from them. <br/>
<br/>
149. One day when her mothers went <br/>
to the pandal of Madhavi flowers<br/>
she also went with them.<br/>
<br/>
Eight miracle stories of Shiva<br/>
<br/>
150 - 153. The pethai listened <br/>
carefully and lovingly <br/>
to the stories of Lord Shiva’s miracles. <br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
bringing the ocean <br/>
to please his beloved Shakthi.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
giving moksha to Shakthi’s father <br/>
to please her who is decorated <br/>
with elegant bangles. <br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
giving birth to their son Ukkira Pandyan, <br/>
who was born to please the earth.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva who carries an axe<br/>
giving his son Ukkiran <br/>
a spear, a discus and a sendu weapon. <br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
destroying the strong forts <br/>
on the dark ocean with his spear. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva<br/>
breaking the crown of the god Indra<br/>
with a powerful discus.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
imprinting the fish symbol <br/>
on strong, golden Meru <br/>
mountain in the north.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
teaching the truth of the Vedas <br/>
to the divine Rishis.<br/>
<br/>
154, 155. She with her puvai bird <br/>
and the parrots of the fields<br/>
listened with love the stories and <br/>
the thiruppatikams of the three saints <br/>
that give moksha to those who hear.<br/>
At that time musical instruments <br/>
were played to announce <br/>
the procession of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
156, 157. Musical instuments praise the Lord <br/>
<br/>
“He is a marvelous dancer<br/>
He is the truth.<br/>
He is faultless. <br/>
He is eternal pleasure .<br/>
He never forgets his promises.<br/>
He is the Lord of northern Meru mountain<br/>
He gives boons to his devotees.<br/>
His paths are righteous.<br/>
He is pure. <br/>
He is compassionate.<br/>
He stays on the banks of the Vaigai river.<br/>
He is Abhisheka Chokkar.”<br/>
All the musical instruments <br/>
sounded praising Shiva <br/>
when he came in procession <br/>
on the rich streets. <br/>
<br/>
158. She walked towards the procession <br/>
with her mothers and <br/>
her soft lotus feet grew red from walking.<br/>
<br/>
159. She was happy and <br/>
fascinated to see the Lord.<br/>
She worshipped him <br/>
folding her two hands <br/>
and said to her mothers, 
<br/>
160. “Oh, swan, Oh Puvai bird, <br/>
Oh peacock of the forest,<br/>
Oh, beautiful parrot, <br/>
Oh doll, look at him here.<br/>
<br/>
161. “Has the Lord <br/>
who loves the deer he holds in his one hand <br/>
and the parrot he holds in the other <br/>
come here wishing to join<br/>
and play with us?<br/>
<br/>
162. “Does the Lord come near <br/>
my little play-house because <br/>
he wants to eat our food <br/>
or learn how to play the game of kalangu <br/>
that I have learned”<br/>
<br/>
163. “Please tell me<br/>
what the Lord who cannot be <br/>
described by anyone intends.”<br/>
This is what she asked her mothers. <br/>
and they embraced her and said,<br/>
<br/>
164. “Is it right if you say the highest Lord <br/>
who did sixty-four tiruvilaiyadals <br/>
will come to play with you?<br/>
<br/>
165. “He does not take the sacrificial food <br/>
given to him by the Rishis, <br/>
who are excellent scholars of the great Vedas.<br/>
Will he come for the simple food <br/>
that you have cooked?<br/>
<br/>
166. “Is it fair to say <br/>
the eternal one <br/>
who dances in the silver hall <br/>
will leave his important duties <br/>
and come here to learn <br/>
to play kazangu? <br/>
Wouldn’t that be a miracle?”<br/>
167. When the mothers said this <br/>
she who was lovely as a deer asked, <br/>
“Then why did he come here?”<br/>
<br/>
168. They answered, <br/>
“Oh girl, lovely as a creeper!<br/>
The Lord who performs five surpassing actions <br/>
comes in the procession <br/>
to give joy and moksha to all lives.”<br/>
<br/>
169. The pethai asked, “Please put me<br/>
on the radiant chariot <br/>
of the eternal lord <br/>
on whose red jata the Ganges flows.” <br/>
<br/>
170. Her dark eyes shed tears<br/>
and her heart weakened, <br/>
like those who fall in deep love.<br/>
<br/>
171, 172. The mothers said<br/>
“Are there any other women like her?” <br/>
The pethai removed her bangles<br/>
and some of her golden ornaments. <br/>
She shed tears washing away <br/>
some of the kohl in her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
173. Lustrous as lightning,<br/>
she seemed a woman of forty years.<br/>
Seeing her all were surprised. <br/>
<br/>
174. She stood rooted in place.<br/>
Her mothers embraced her and <br/>
took her inside their splendid palace.<br/>
<br/>
Pethumbai<br/>
<br/>
175. The pethumbai was a woman <br/>
who had reached the next age<br/>
after the pethai.<br/>
<br/>
176. She was beautiful as a creeper <br/>
not yet fully grown.<br/>
Her breasts were like two lotus buds.<br/>
<br/>
177. The power of her breasts <br/>
was like the flood with its underwater fire <br/>
come to destroy the world.<br/>
Seeing her, the sages who did great tapas <br/>
folded their hands to worship her.<br/>
<br/>
178. Looking at her the cruel Yama <br/>
opened his eyes like blossoms.<br/>
Watching her, passionate men’s bodies<br/>
felt abundant joy.<br/>
Her soft breasts grew <br/>
larger like buds <br/>
opening into blossoms<br/>
<br/>
179. Her waist became <br/>
thinner day by day <br/>
like the bad karma <br/>
of those who do tapas<br/>
and so gain good karma<br/>
<br/>
180. Her eyes were <br/>
like the limitless poison <br/>
that came out of <br/>
the ocean of milk. <br/>
They stole <br/>
everyone’s heart.<br/>
<br/>
181, 182. Her hair was tied up together. <br/>
Bees swarmed around <br/>
the garlands on her hair.<br/>
It looked like <br/>
the fearsome darkness<br/>
that covers the whole world<br/>
and helps kama to finish <br/>
all that he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
183. Neither the beauty of mullai buds <br/>
that grow tall <br/>
nor the feathers of peacocks <br/>
could compete <br/>
with her young proud smile.<br/>
<br/>
184. She had grown up beautifully <br/>
as if lightning had taken a form <br/>
and glowed ever more and more.<br/>
She was sweet like honey.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
185. She got up when the sun rose <br/>
and came leaving her bed<br/>
sprinkled with blossoms.<br/>
One of her beautiful maids <br/>
came, bowed to her, <br/>
folding her flower-like hands,<br/>
and told her.<br/>
<br/>
186. “The beauty of your eyes could kill.<br/>
Come to see the divine pond <br/>
that has the water of the seven oceans.”<br/>
<br/>
187. Crores of her friends <br/>
who had beautiful eyes <br/>
and dark hair came <br/>
together to the pond. <br/>
<br/>
188. Decorated with bright ornaments <br/>
she came to the pond <br/>
in the fragrant flourishing grove. <br/>
<br/>
189. One of her friends said to her.<br/>
“You are bright like lightning.<br/>
You are sweet as nectar.<br/>
You are like a flourishing crop.<br/>
You are a like a splendid red lotus.<br/>
You are lustrous as gold.<br/>
Come to this pond.<br/>
<br/>
190. “Look at the beautiful season <br/>
that makes women fall in love <br/>
with the highest Lord as he comes in procession.<br/>
<br/>
191. “See how the king swan climbs <br/>
joyfully on pure conches <br/>
in the pond and calls.<br/>
<br/>
192. “See how the young female swan <br/>
welcomes with affection<br/>
the male swan that comes to join her.<br/>
<br/>
193, 194. “See how the red lotus buds open up <br/>
as they feel the shining rays of the sun<br/>
like the hearts of the devotees <br/>
who love, understand and melt <br/>
in devotion for the Lord who has thick Jata <br/>
and comes in procession<br/>
<br/>
195, 196. “See how the soft coral creepers <br/>
grow thick and embrace the beautiful naakaa trees<br/>
that look like the kings<br/>
who wish to embrace <br/>
the chest of the Lord of Madhurapuri<br/>
creator of the Vedas<br/>
who rides on a sky chariot. <br/>
<br/>
197. “Come to this pond <br/>
where the water of<br/>
all the great oceans <br/>
has come together,<br/>
and bathe joyfully.”<br/>
<br/>
198. After hearing her friend, <br/>
the pethumbai entered the water shyly <br/>
as her mothers smiled, came, <br/>
and bathed her with love. <br/>
<br/>
199. Women surrounded her and praised her <br/>
saying that she was born <br/>
in the water of seven oceans<br/>
like Lakshmi, born in the ocean of milk.<br/>
<br/>
200. After bathing, she went to the <br/>
fertile grove of Surapunnai trees on the shore <br/>
and sat on a lovely fragrant seat.<br/>
<br/>
201. She wore fine ornaments <br/>
and sacred ash that protected her. <br/>
Her mothers with pleasant faces <br/>
blessed her.<br/>
<br/>
202. A storyteller praised the pond <br/>
and then told the stories of Shiva <br/>
to the pethumbai decorated with <br/>
bright golden ornaments. <br/>
<br/>
Eight miracle stories of Shiva <br/>
<br/>
203. The story of Shiva <br/>
selling diamonds <br/>
for the world to flourish.<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
giving his grace to the large clouds <br/>
so that they could drink<br/>
the water of the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
204. The story of Shiva <br/>
changing the name <br/>
of the capital city<br/>
with its gorgeous palaces<br/>
from Madurai to Kudal. <br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva coming <br/>
as an all-powerful siddha <br/>
<br/>
205. The story of Shiva <br/>
making the stone <br/>
elephant of the Pandya king <br/>
eat a sugarcane stalk.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
killing the rutting elephant<br/>
that approached him,<br/>
sent by the terrible Jains.<br/>
<br/>
206. The story of Shiva <br/>
changing himself into many forms <br/>
that cannot be described— <br/>
an old man, a young man <br/>
and a child.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
wearing the Athi garland, <br/>
dancing in Madurai <br/>
and raising his left foot.<br/>
<br/>
207. Hearing the stories of Shiva <br/>
and giving presents to the storyteller, <br/>
her mind and thoughts were immersed <br/>
in the love for <br/>
the pure Lord Shiva.<br/>
<br/>
208, 209. The pethumbai, the best among women, <br/>
beautiful as Lakshmi<br/>
who sits on a lotus flower,<br/>
heard the miracle stories of Shiva.<br/>
Wishing to see <br/>
the procession of the faultless God, <br/>
she walked to the garden and sat.<br/>
<br/>
210, 211 “Lord Shiva wears sacred ashes.<br/>
He carries a bull flag.<br/>
He is beloved of goddess Uma.<br/>
He, Chokkanaadar <br/>
of Kadamba forest, comes <br/>
in procession on a rutting elephant.”<br/>
Thus praising Shiva, the procession <br/>
of Lord Shiva was announced<br/>
with the beating of drums. <br/>
<br/>
212. Her friends, precious as her heart,<br/>
went in front of the procession,<br/>
and she ran behind them.<br/>
Her heart was filled with abundant joy <br/>
when she saw the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
213. Shiva’s arms became soft<br/>
when he embraced the breasts <br/>
of his beloved wife, <br/>
the princess of the Himalayas<br/>
who never stops giving <br/>
her grace to her devotees. <br/>
That marvelous Shiva <br/>
came in procession.<br/>
<br/>
214. Shiva’s chest was beautified <br/>
with marks made by the <br/>
breasts of the goddess Uma, <br/>
whom the ancient Vedas praise and <br/>
whose beauty cannot be described. <br/>
That handsome Shiva <br/>
came in procession.<br/>
<br/>
215. All worshipped <br/>
the divine feet of Lord Shiva <br/>
who does not differentiate <br/>
between his devotees.<br/>
The grace of the Lord of Thiruvaalavaay <br/>
takes away the bad karma <br/>
of his devotees.<br/>
That faultless Shiva <br/>
came in procession<br/>
216. The pethumbai saw the Lord<br/>
and worshipped him.<br/>
She tried to calm her excited mind <br/>
that was fixed to him.<br/>
She was shy.<br/>
<br/>
217. She sweated.<br/>
She had never seen such <br/>
a procession before.<br/>
Seeing the Lord was a feast <br/>
for her eyes and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
218. She felt passion <br/>
she had never felt. <br/>
The love that she had for the Lord<br/>
made her beautiful <br/>
like buds opening into blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
219. Her lovely eyes like Kendai fish <br/>
saw the procession unlike anything <br/>
they had never seen and<br/>
her heart felt joy <br/>
that it had never experienced.<br/>
<br/>
220. Her mothers said, <br/>
“She could not think of <br/>
anything except our Lord.<br/>
Has she lost her chastity? <br/>
What can we say?<br/>
<br/>
221, 222. “Her face, shoulders, breasts <br/>
and shining curly hair <br/>
seem to ask <br/>
Kama to come to fight,<br/>
and her heart gives her strength.<br/>
The king of love, Kama <br/>
does not stop <br/>
sending his fragrant arrows.<br/>
<br/>
223. “The waist ornament <br/>
that we tied on her with love <br/>
is growing loose.<br/>
The bracelets that we put <br/>
on her beautiful arms <br/>
fall from her wrists.<br/>
224, 225. “As if she suddenly has grown more mature <br/>
her body has changed and is more <br/>
attractive than ever before.<br/>
Her beauty has increased <br/>
beyond what is suitable for her age.<br/>
Who knows why this happened ?”<br/>
<br/>
226, 227. Before Kama sent<br/>
his flower arrows from his bow <br/>
and before her passion increased, <br/>
the mothers embraced her <br/>
whose curly hair<br/>
decorated with garlands,<br/>
swarmed with bees. <br/>
<br/>
228. They went to their guarded palace,<br/>
put her on her lovely<br/>
flower-strewn bed<br/>
and consoled her so that <br/>
her passion would be calmed.<br/>
<br/>
Mangai<br/>
<br/>
229. There was a girl of the age of a mangai.<br/>
Her black eyes grew red with passion.<br/>
<br/>
230. She was beautiful as a peacock.<br/>
Her mind always thought only of <br/>
the strong hill-like shoulders of the Lord <br/>
who carries the lustrous moon in his Jata.<br/>
<br/>
231. The compassion of the highest God, <br/>
the Lord of Thiruvaalavaay<br/>
is like a flooding pond, <br/>
and she was like a lovely swan <br/>
searching for<br/>
that compassion of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
232. She was like a parrot<br/>
whose heart melted away<br/>
with love for the groves <br/>
of the Kadamba Forest<br/>
where the breeze is always blowing.<br/>
<br/>
233 - 236. Her hair had grown thicker<br/>
and thicker than the attractive groves <br/>
of the love world <br/>
that Kama created. <br/>
<br/>
234. The power of Kama was growing<br/>
and growing<br/>
as her long hair <br/>
grew more and more beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
235, 236. Seeing her lovely hair, the<br/>
hearts of those who did tapas<br/>
grew weak and soft. <br/>
She gave a victory <br/>
that no one had achieved before to <br/>
Kama so that he could destroy <br/>
the strength of the sages.<br/>
<br/>
237. Her shining eyes<br/>
had the power to end life,<br/>
as long ago when<br/>
the spear of Murugan<br/>
sailed to drink <br/>
the ocean’s crashing waves.<br/>
<br/>
238. She wore shining <br/>
golden bracelets on her arms.<br/>
<br/>
239 -242. Her breasts were like two <br/>
angry elephants that stir up water <br/>
then stand on the shore<br/>
crushing fragrant lotus buds,<br/>
and then climb on mountain forts.<br/>
<br/>
243. Shiva shines <br/>
like a pure golden hill. <br/>
He is the tender shoot of Saivism.<br/>
He gives half of his body <br/>
to Shakthi, the fish-eyed goddess.<br/>
<br/>
244. He is the Lord Chokkan, <br/>
who mesmerizes us. <br/>
Even the Vedas <br/>
that are with him always <br/>
could not find<br/>
that highest one. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
245. The divine, compassionate Lord<br/>
gives prosperity to those <br/>
who worship and serve him. <br/>
He is the remedy for everything. <br/>
He is a companion for all souls.<br/>
<br/>
246. Even though she saw <br/>
Lord Shiva in the procession<br/>
only that one day,<br/>
her heart felt great joy <br/>
as if it were a day of celebration.<br/>
<br/>
247. She was divine as Lakshmi.<br/>
She went to worship the Lord <br/>
with crores of her friends<br/>
surrounding her on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
248. She went to the mandapam <br/>
that was in the middle <br/>
of a flower garden <br/>
where divine fresh blossoms <br/>
were blooming near a pond. <br/>
<br/>
249. She went to that pond <br/>
near the Vaigai River <br/>
where the poems written<br/>
on palm leaves by Sambandar <br/>
floated above the water <br/>
when they were thrown <br/>
there by the Jains.<br/>
<br/>
250. She went and sat there <br/>
on a divine golden seat <br/>
studded with coral and pearls <br/>
like a swan that sits <br/>
on a lotus blossom.<br/>
<br/>
251, 252. One of her friends told the mangai<br/>
that if she played on the swing <br/>
she would be happy.<br/>
She got up, <br/>
went to the shining swing <br/>
studded with diamonds <br/>
and sat on it.<br/>
Seeing her on the swing, kama <br/>
the king of love was intoxicated.<br/>
253. The sweat on her face <br/>
looked like the drops of sweet nectar<br/>
that bubble and drip from the moon.<br/>
<br/>
254. The dark pupils of her <br/>
long spear-like eyes<br/>
as they went back and forth <br/>
distressed the hearts of the sages <br/>
wherever they did tapas <br/>
<br/>
255. The bees that swarmed <br/>
on her thick hair<br/>
sang as if they were <br/>
crying out in happiness <br/>
after conquering <br/>
thick darkness <br/>
and the pouring rain.<br/>
<br/>
256. Her beautiful hands, <br/>
as lovely as tender mango shoots <br/>
or red kandal flowers, <br/>
were decorated with <br/>
lovely bracelets <br/>
that jingled sweetly.<br/>
<br/>
257. Her lovely kaanji ornament<br/>
jingled and sounded like the famous song<br/>
that the warriors sang when <br/>
they conquered lightning. <br/>
<br/>
258. Her lotus-colored legs were proud <br/>
as if they had conquered swans <br/>
and beautiful lotuses. <br/>
The anklets on her lovely legs <br/>
sounded victoriously when they jingled.<br/>

like a female elephant. <br/>

the divine Shakthi<br/>
went on the street <br/>
riding his horse, which was the Vedas.<br/>
<br/>

She was a queen among women.<br/>
Her friends and those <br/>
who saw her suffering in love, <br/>
pitied her.<br/>
Her maidens embraced her<br/>
and entered the palace beautiful as lotuses. <br/>
<br/>
280. They put her on a flower-covered bed <br/>
where the bees swarmed.<br/>
The Sun god who spreads <br/>
his red rays in the day <br/>
set in the west.<br/>
<br/>
281. Coming before thick darkness<br/>
magical evenings confuse lovers.<br/>
Such an evening came <br/>
and bewitched her.<br/>
<br/>
282. As she looked at the beautiful garland <br/>
that decorated her breast, <br/>
her heart was disturbed, <br/>
longing for the love of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
283. She said, <br/>
“The terrible one, the rising white moon, <br/>
shoots red fire at me.<br/>
How can my <br/>
weak woman’s mind bear it?”<br/>
<br/>
284. Her eyes shed tears. <br/>
Her mind was longing <br/>
for the Lord’s love. She was tired. <br/>
She called her cuckoo bird.<br/>
Her body was burning.<br/>
<br/>
285. She asked the king of bees to come <br/>
and then immediately told him to leave.<br/>
She called her lovely parrot <br/>
to give her a kiss.<br/>
She asked her friends and mothers <br/>
to bring the Lord’s garland<br/>
and give it to her.<br/>
<br/>
286, 287. Her mothers seeing <br/>
her trouble consoled her.<br/>
They said, “You who are adorned <br/>
with beautiful ornaments,<br/>
we will go in the morning <br/>
and tell your love to the Lord, <br/>
for whom there is no comparison<br/>
so that you can embrace his handsome chest <br/>
and arms decorated with garlands. <br/>
Calm your passion <br/>
that rises like a swelling ocean.”<br/>

and consoled her.<br/>

Madanthai<br/>

valampuri conch to Kama <br/>
so he would be victorious <br/>
as he kindled love.<br/>

bow of Kama,<br/>
praised by the whole world.<br/>

She was the strength of Kama.<br/>
<br/>

saved by Kama.<br/>
She was the sceptre of Kama.<br/>
She was the victorious <br/>
coral garland of Kama.<br/>
She was Kama’s crown <br/>
that was studded with pearls. <br/>
292. Her mouth was so red <br/>
that even a hundred crores <br/>
of red kumudam flowers<br/>
dripping with honey<br/>
could not compete <br/>
with the color of her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
293. Her golden earrings were bright.<br/>
They swung like golden swings<br/>
as they enticed the minds of <br/>
all the people on earth, <br/>
making them fall in love with her. <br/>
<br/>
294, 295. Her eyes were like cruel spears <br/>
more terrible than the cruel sceptres <br/>
of the unjust kings who did <br/>
evil deeds.<br/>
Those spear-like eyes disturbed <br/>
the minds of the learned scholars of Vedas<br/>
and the wise. <br/>
<br/>

Indra carried mountains. <br/>
He raised his vajra weapon against them.<br/>
He performed sacrifices on the day<br/>
of the star of magam.<br/>
He was cursed by the sage Gauthama <br/>
and received a thousand eyes. <br/>
He rides on a strong elephant.<br/>
He wears a beautiful garland <br/>
made of buds and leaves.<br/>
The madanthai’s breasts that <br/>
were as strong as Indra <br/>
wished to destroy the tapas of the sages<br/>
like Indra when <br/>
he got angry with the rishis.<br/>
<br/>
299. Her lovely, perfect waist <br/>
became more and more thin <br/>
like the hearts of those <br/>
who suffer and wander <br/>
in the land of tyrant kings.<br/>
<br/>
300. Her lovely teeth <br/>
infatuated men <br/>
and looked like a chain <br/>
of precious cool pearls <br/>
blooming on a red lotus.<br/>
<br/>
301, 302. She told her sweet parrot <br/>
adoringly, <br/>
“One half of his body <br/>
is his wife, lovely as a peacock.<br/>
He is our king.<br/>
He rules all the seven worlds.<br/>
He is the Lord of Thiruvaalavaay.<br/>
I long to embrace his divine arms. <br/>
Please go to him as my messenger.”<br/>
<br/>
303. As she lay on her bed<br/>
and evening arrived<br/>
she was worried in her heart.<br/>
She was like a streak of lightning<br/>
that had been painted in a picture.<br/>
<br/>
304. She worshipped the Lord, <br/>
unable to bear her sorrow, <br/>
and in her passion, she told her friends,<br/>
“I am alone,<br/>
who is there to console me?”<br/>
<br/>
305. One lady wearing lovely ornaments, <br/>
excellent in playing <br/>
sweet music on the yaaz,<br/>

echoing like a mass of clouds.<br/>

that the madanthai had sent<br/>
flew to see the Lord,<br/>
returned and told her, <br/>
<br/>
“He is the Lord of Arunachalam hills.<br/>
He is unshakable<br/>
He is flawless.<br/>
He is unique.<br/>
He is formless<br/>
and yet has a form.<br/>
He is a beloved of two wives and <br/>
they both love him.<br/>

He is the Lord of Madurai.<br/>
He is the chief of all the worlds.<br/>
He is the enemy of Kama in the war of love.<br/>
He is the happy lover of <br/>
the daughter of Himalayas.<br/>
He is the measureless one<br/>

shone like gold.<br/>
They were as sweet as nectar.<br/>

Her sweet words were  musical<br/>
like the song of a cuckoo.<br/>

disturbed his meditation.<br/>
She came gently like Spring. <br/>

<br/>
333. “Which is more golden,<br/>

<br/>
336. The Lord graciously granted her<br/>
the boon of seeing his divine form.<br/>

with a shining crown <br/>
as the sages on earth <br/>
praised her.<br/>
<br/>
338. The ocean of milk gave nectar <br/>
when the gods and <br/>
the Asuras churned it.<br/>
Yet it is not only the ocean<br/>
that yields nectar for the world<br/>
but the arivai also.<br/>
<br/>
339. She was a priceless pearl <br/>
on the earth.<br/>
She was a faultless diamond.<br/>
She was a cool lotus.<br/>
She was precious wealth.<br/>
<br/>
340. She was as divine as a goddess.<br/>
Her hips were so wide <br/>
that all the lands in the directions <br/>
of the earth could not be <br/>
as wide as they were.<br/>
<br/>
341, 342. Her forehead was like the bow <br/>
that Kama carries and<br/>
her hair was decorated <br/>
with a lovely, fresh garland<br/>
that was like Kama’s flower arrows<br/>
and so her dark hair, buzzing with bees,<br/>
was like the form of that god of love.<br/>
<br/>
343. If she wore shining <br/>
golden ornaments on <br/>
her breasts they would look <br/>
like two golden Meru mountains. <br/>
<br/>
344. If she wore chains studded <br/>
with diamonds and <br/>
pearls on her breasts <br/>
they would look like two silver hills<br/>
<br/>
345. If she wore bright diamonds <br/>
on her breasts that <br/>
attract hearts of everyone, <br/>
they would look like<br/>
two burning suns rising <br/>
on two hills. <br/>
<br/>
346. Looking at her breasts <br/>
the hearts of sages throbbed, <br/>
Kama danced and <br/>
even Yama was entranced.<br/>
<br/>
347. Her breasts swelled with pride <br/>
melting the hearts of everyone<br/>
and straining her thin waist <br/>
even more than before.<br/>
<br/>
348. Her eyes were like arrows<br/>
sent by strong warriors <br/>
to tear the chests <br/>
of their enemies in battle.<br/>
<br/>
349. Without any weapons, <br/>
her long, big dark <br/>
eyes wandered <br/>
all over the world <br/>
like the messengers <br/>
sent by angry Yama.<br/>
<br/>
350. Her eyes brought trouble.<br/>
poisonous and inimical.<br/>
They had the power<br/>
to take away the life of anyone they saw.<br/>
They were wide and <br/>
gave pleasure to all<br/>
who saw her.<br/>
<br/>
351. Her eyes were like<br/>
the tandam weapon <br/>
of cruel Yama<br/>
that takes away the lives <br/>
of those who live in this world.<br/>
<br/>
352. She wanted the divine garland <br/>
of the God of Thiruvalavaay.<br/>
The love that <br/>
she had for that garland<br/>
made her pain even harder to bear.<br/>
353. One day she came <br/>
to a garden blooming with lovely flowers. <br/>
She was surrounded by Kama<br/>
who carries flower arrows<br/>
and many crores of her friends <br/>
<br/>
354. She saw the Themaa tree and felt happy.<br/>
She asked her friends, <br/>
“Why do I feel happy <br/>
when I stay in the shadow of this Themaa tree?”<br/>
<br/>
355. Her adoring friend <br/>
who was as tender as a flower, <br/>
told her,
“Lovely one! <br/>
You are as precious as our life.<br/>
You are like sweet nectar.”<br/>
<br/>
356. “A long time ago, <br/>
the Lord embraced his wife <br/>
the goddess Uma, lovely as a deer,<br/>
and the mother of all seven worlds,<br/>
under this Temaa tree<br/>
<br/>
357, 358. “and her breasts and her bracelets <br/>
marked the faultless chest of the Lord. <br/>
Don’t you know, that is the reason <br/>
that you are drawn to this tree <br/>
whose flowers drip honey.”<br/>
Listening to this the arivai <br/>
became shy and was filled with shame.<br/>
<br/>
359. She asked her friend,<br/>
“Do you know any other trees <br/>
where the generous Lord likes to stay?”<br/>
Her friend said, <br/>
<br/>
360, 361, 362. “My friend, you who have have dark fragrant hair, <br/>
the Lord likes to stay in many trees— <br/>
the banian tree, the Makiza tree, <br/>
the lovely Thillai tree, the Aatti tree, the Kuraa tree, <br/>
the Marutu tree, the Paalai tree, the Palaa tree, <br/>
the white naaval tree, the Paadalam tree,<br/>
and the beautiful MarukkonRai tree.<br/>
The Lord Chokkanadar stays beneath <br/>
the sacred Kadamba tree <br/>
in the city of Thiruvaalavaay, <br/>
praised by all.”<br/>
<br/>
363. When her friend told the arivai<br/>
all the trees beneath which Lord Shiva stays,<br/>
the arivai’s heart and her long wide <br/>
lotus-like eyes were pleased. <br/>
<br/>
364. She went near the Kadamba tree and <br/>
asked for refuge under it.<br/>
She worshipped the tree <br/>
and said with love, <br/>
<br/>
365. “The Lord is escorted <br/>
and worshipped <br/>
by the gods Vishnu and Brahma.<br/>
The great Vedas praise him.<br/>
The scholarly sages rejoice to see him.<br/>
<br/>
366. “Your blossoms decorate his Jata.<br/>
You have the fortune <br/>
that he stays beneath you.<br/>
You are equal to Shiva’s abode.<br/>
<br/>
367. “Kama, the incomparable one <br/>
is shooting his flower arrows at me.<br/>
My love is growing and I am exhausted.<br/>
Let me tell you the sacred acts of Lord Shiva.”<br/>

showing pity without <br/>
expecting anything back.<br/>
Will the God give us his grace? <br/>
Or will he leave <br/>
without having pity on us?”<br/>
<br/>
373. While she was speaking, <br/>
the drum were beaten to announce <br/>
that the Lord was coming <br/>
in the procession.<br/>
<br/>
374. Her two eyebrows were <br/>
like two victorious bows.<br/>
Her precious ornaments <br/>
shone like lightning.<br/>
<br/>
375. Her dark hair decorated with blossoms <br/>
was like a clusters of clouds<br/>
as abundant honey dripped <br/>
from the blossoms like rain.<br/>
<br/>
376. Her neck, eyes, hands <br/>
and nose were soft and lovely <br/>
like karuvilai flowers <br/>
and kandal blossoms.<br/>
377. Her breasts decorated <br/>
with shining pearls <br/>
and strings of chains,<br/>
looked like hills<br/>
as waterfalls drop from them.<br/>
<br/>
378. She came on the street <br/>
like the rainy season arriving,<br/>
blooming with fragrant flowers<br/>
nourishing the crop of love.<br/>
<br/>
379 - 382. Shiva is our father.<br/>
He is all the arts.<br/>
He has no lineage.<br/>
He has the beautiful moon on his jata.<br/>
He is the lover of Uma and he is praised by Indra.<br/>
He destroys the enemies of the gods.<br/>
He wears a garland of skulls.<br/>
He burned the three forts.<br/>
He is the highest of all.<br/>
He is the ancient Lord.<br/>
He is worshipped by the hunter Thinnan.<br/>
His eyes shed grace. <br/>
His body is the color of red coral. <br/>
He is skilled and clever.<br/>
He is the king of Madurai city.<br/>
He is the master of all the sixty-four arts.<br/>
He is our God.<br/>
He is the highest Lord.<br/>
He wears a garland of bones.<br/>
The Lord who stays in the silver mountain<br/>
came on his strong bull in the procession.<br/>
<br/>
383. She adored Shiva<br/>
and worshipped him. <br/>
She who was timid, <br/>
grew bold enough to express her love <br/>
and began in a few words <br/>
to describe what she felt. <br/>
<br/>
384, 385. “People bring you <br/>
a garland of kuvaLai flowers, <br/>
and say its fragrance is for you.<br/>
They bring sweet-smelling water <br/>
and say it is for your bath.<br/>
Oh, Lord, why won’t you tell me <br/>
how I can be bold enough <br/>
to serve you?<br/>
<br/>
386. “Yesterday the strong breeze <br/>
came and made my desire for you <br/>
even greater.<br/>
If it comes again as it did yesterday <br/>
how could I bear it?<br/>
<br/>
387. “The rays sent by the moon <br/>
are hot fire to burn me.<br/>
The sandal trees on the hills <br/>
burn me with fragrance they send.<br/>
Even the cool pearls <br/>
on my body burn me.<br/>
<br/>
388. “Is this suffering only for me, <br/>
or do all others feel the same way?<br/>
You wear golden kondrai flowers <br/>
and are proud that you possess gold.<br/>
<br/>
389. “Look at me. Do not laugh.<br/>
If you do not give me your grace, <br/>
Kama will come and fight with me. <br/>
Do you think I am strong enough <br/>
to fight with him?<br/>
<br/>
390. “You have made my bangles loose.<br/>
You have stolen my beauty and my heart.<br/>
I am exhausted<br/>
and people gossip about me.<br/>
If only this fatigue could go away.<br/>
<br/>
390. “If only this love for you would go away!”<br/>
She spoke in the presence of the Lord <br/>
as he went in procession and stood there.<br/>
<br/>
Therivai<br/>
<br/>
391. The therivai was lustrous like lightning.<br/>
She was sweet as nectar.<br/>
She fascinated everyone.<br/>
<br/>
392. She gave sovereignty over <br/>
all the fourteen worlds <br/>
<br/>
to Kama who carries a sugarcane bow,<br/>
so they were all ruled under on umbrella.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
393. Her eyes were sharp like spears<br/>
that pierce people’s hearts.<br/>
and hurt like strong poison <br/>
that has no remedy. 
<br/>
394. She taught Yama <br/>
who was not easy to approach <br/>
the art of killing.<br/>
She was an accomplished scholar of <br/>
the book of love written by Kama.<br/>
<br/>
395. Her eyes wandered all over <br/>
like the tempestuous oceans that <br/>
rise at the end of the age <br/>
to destroy the world. <br/>
<br/>
396, 397. The therivai’s long, thick, dark hair<br/>
was like the cruel bond Yama uses<br/>
to bind people, <br/>
threaten them,<br/>
and take their lives.<br/>
<br/>
398 - 399. Vishnu sleeps on the snake bed.<br/>
He married the beautiful Lakshmi. <br/>
As Vamana <br/>
he measured the world. <br/>
He showed Yasodha <br/>
the world in his mouth<br/>
when he came to the earth <br/>
as the child Krishna.<br/>
He gave sweetness <br/>
to the world as Krishna <br/>
with his mischievous play.<br/>
<br/>
400. The therivai’s breast were <br/>
decorated with lovely ornaments <br/>
like Vishnu.<br/>
As sweet as nectar <br/>
they gave joy to others. <br/>
They were round and majestic as hills.<br/>
<br/>
401. Her ample breasts were fragrant, <br/>
smeared with a mixture of <br/>
sandal paste<br/>
and perfumed water.<br/>
402. Not even a faultless and skilled painter <br/>
could paint her waist, <br/>
because it is so small.<br/>
<br/>
403. The sun, praised by all <br/>
set in the west <br/>
and the beautiful <br/>
moon rose in the east.<br/>
<br/>
404. She went to the divine <br/>
and magnificent mandapam <br/>
where a pleasant breeze blew gently.<br/>
Many of her friends surrounded her<br/>
and adored her.<br/>
<br/>
405, 406. She sat there attracting,<br/>
and mesmerizing the minds of the others.<br/>
Because she was afraid that Kama would start<br/>
his war of love,<br/>
she did not tell her feelings <br/>
to her friends whose mouths are red<br/>
as kovai fruits. <br/>
She talked to her Puvai bird <br/>
as if she was instructing it.<br/>
<br/>
407. She told of the glory of Shiva,<br/>
the God of gods, the ancient one,<br/>
the king of beautiful Thiruvaalavaay.<br/>
<br/>
408. The story of Shiva<br/>
when Madurai received <br/>
the name Thiruvaalavaay.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva<br/>
destroying with his strong arrows, <br/>
the army of the Chola king <br/>
who carried a shining sword.<br/>
<br/>
409. The story of Shiva<br/>
giving the Sangappalahai to the poets<br/>
so they would receive fame.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva<br/>
composing a poem<br/>
‘konguter” for Dharmi a poor man<br/>
so he could receive gold <br/>
from the Pandya king.<br/>
<br/>
410. The story of Shiva<br/>
arguing with the great poet Nakkirar <br/>
because Nakkirar found fault<br/>
with his poem, ‘konguter.’<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva<br/>
listening to Tamil poems<br/>
from the sage Nakkirar.<br/>
<br/>
411. The story of Shiva<br/>
making Rudrasanmar, who was dumb <br/>
speak in Tamil <br/>
and become a poet in the language.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva<br/>
going to North Madhura <br/>
to help Idaikkaadar. <br/>
<br/>
412. Listening to the stories of Shiva,<br/>
she was happy.<br/>
The sun, lover of lotuses, rose<br/>
from its mountain, praised by all.<br/>
<br/>
413. The darkness that entirely <br/>
covered the world dispersed.<br/>
Her face showed happiness.<br/>
She was as lovely as a painting,<br/>
as she arose from sleep in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
414. She approached <br/>
the pond of the temple <br/>
blooming with golden lotuses<br/>
in the Kadampa forest<br/>
that is praised by scholars<br/>
who have learned all three branches of Tamil,<br/>
prose, music and drama.<br/>
<br/>
415. She saw that wide pond <br/>
and wondered how large it was.<br/>
<br/>
She was captivated by the pond <br/>
and said lovingly to her friends, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
416. “This pond is beautiful, <br/>
filled with diamond-like blue water. <br/>
that looks like the dark hair of girls, <br/>
and is cool like <br/>
the happy minds of women <br/>
who fall in love with the highest one.<br/>
<br/>
417. “The blooming lotuses in the pond <br/>
remind us of the happy faces <br/>
of the women who love the Lord. <br/>
The pond is filled with pearls,<br/>
like the women, ornamented with pearl necklaces, <br/>
who fell in love with the eternal one .<br/>
It is filled with conches<br/>
like the hands of women,<br/>
decorated with conch bracelets,<br/>
who love the magnificent Lord.<br/>
<br/>
418. “This pond is like the women <br/>
who received the garland of Shiva<br/>
that buzzed with bees,<br/>
satisfying their desire<br/>
and making them happy.<br/>
<br/>
419. “This pond is like the women <br/>
who are in love with the Lord in all these ways.”<br/>
This is what the therivai said to her friends<br/>
as she fell in love with Shiva.<br/>
<br/>
420. She said, “Oh, Lord, you have satisfied <br/>
my desire just as you took away <br/>
the bad Karma of the god Indra <br/>
who has a thousand eyes.”<br/>
<br/>
421. She bathed and decorated herself<br/>
with precious clothes and ornaments. <br/>
She went to the bank of the pond.<br/>
The Paanan who played <br/>
lovely music on his yaaz<br/>
came, bowed to her and said, <br/>
<br/>
422. “You shine like lightning. <br/>
You are lovely like the victorious <br/>
goddess of the Lord, the king of dance.<br/>
Today the Lord will come in procession.”<br/>
<br/>
That is how the Paanan announced <br/>
the procession of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
423. She gave silk clothes <br/>
and precious ornaments <br/>
to the Paanan who said <br/>
kind words to her.<br/>
She went to the beautiful palace <br/>
and sat on her seat.<br/>
<br/>
424. One of her friends <br/>
wearing lovely bracelets<br/>
came near, bowed to her.<br/>
and said, <br/>
<br/>
425. “If you wear golden ornaments<br/>
you will look like the goddess <br/>
Lakshmi who sits on a lotus <br/>
near Vishnu her husband<br/>
as he escorts <br/>
the faultless God of Kudal city <br/>
in the procession.<br/>
<br/>
426. “If you wear <br/>
exquisite diamond ornaments,<br/>
you will look like the goddess Saraswathi<br/>
who gives learning to all.” <br/>
<br/>
427. She was wearing new emerald ornaments<br/>
that shone like the faultless <br/>
rays of the sun that rises in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
428. Her friends decorated the therivai, <br/>
whose face was as bright as the moon. <br/>
They gave in her flower-like hand<br/>
a bunch of alli and kuvalai flowers.<br/>
<br/>
429. Her gentle, beloved friends <br/>
were wearing golden chains<br/>
studded with diamonds <br/>
and strings of pearls.<br/>
430. She asked them<br/>
to stand around her.<br/>
Looking at the Paanan, she said, <br/>
“Please find a simile for how I look.”<br/>
<br/>
431, 432. “You look like the goddess Parvathi, <br/>
the mother of the worlds,<br/>
the daughter of Himalayas <br/>
sitting majestically surrounded<br/>
by the goddesses --<br/>
Lakshmi sitting on her lovely red lotus, <br/>
Saraswathi resting on her white lotus, <br/>
Mandahini, the Ganga and all the Apsaras.”<br/>
<br/>
433. The Paanan played <br/>
sweet music on the yaaz, <br/>
melting everyone’s hearts. <br/>
He stood in front of the therivai <br/>
and described how beautiful <br/>
she was, as she sat before him.<br/>
<br/>
434. The Lord Shiva dances <br/>
raising his left foot <br/>
for the Pandya king of the south.<br/>
He is the origin of all things.<br/>
He is the creator of the Vedas.<br/>
He is the Lord of Kudal city <br/>
filled with abundant palaces.<br/>
<br/>
435. The therivai was sitting majestically<br/>
like a lovely women in a painting, <br/>
and she was falling in love with the Lord, <br/>
plunged into the thought of him. <br/>
Her soul was an ornament for him.<br/>
<br/>
436. The Lord crushed Ravana’s chest <br/>
who carried the Kailasa mountain <br/>
and fought with him.<br/>
There is no one equal to the Lord.<br/>
He is the king of dance.<br/>
<br/>
437. The feet of the Lord kicked <br/>
Yama and conquered him<br/>
when he came to take away <br/>
the life of Markandeya<br/>
<br/>
438. He is the god Brahma who has four heads.<br/>
He is the god Vishnu himself.<br/>
He is the god of destruction.<br/>
He is the king of Madurai.<br/>
He is the beloved of Goddess Uma.<br/>
439. He came in procession <br/>
on his vehicle, a lovely golden Karpaga tree,<br/>
that shed abundant flowers as<br/>
the Vedas praised him.<br/>
<br/>
440. Seeing the the highest one <br/>
on the street she fell in love with him.<br/>
As she hurried and ran to the street,<br/>
both of her eyes were filled with happiness.<br/>
<br/>
441. The Lord who is adorned with <br/>
a kondrai flower garland<br/>
fragrant with marukkozuntu <br/>
swarming with bees<br/>
directed his charming smile to her.<br/>
She was proud and shivered.<br/>
<br/>
442. Her forehead was as beautiful as <br/>
the sugarcane bow of Kama.<br/>
Her face was as lovely as <br/>
a fragrant red lotus.<br/>
<br/>
443. Her white moon-like teeth <br/>
shone like jasmine blossoms.<br/>
Her soft body was lovely like <br/>
the tender leaves of Ashoka tree.<br/>
<br/>
444. The light color of her golden body <br/>
was like yellow Mango blossoms.<br/>
Her dark, happy eyes lovely <br/>
as kuvalai flowers reached to her ears. <br/>
<br/>
445, 446. Her diamond earrings <br/>
swayed like the shark flag of Kama.<br/>
The therivai, precious and ornamented <br/>
stood in victory over Kama, <br/>
the king of beauty, <br/>
because of the grace of Shiva<br/>
who conquered Kama when he<br/>
disturbed his meditation.<br/>
447. The Lord Shiva has Shakthi, the goddess, <br/>
as half of his body.<br/>
He dances in the beautiful <br/>
silver hall in Madurai.<br/>
<br/>
His procession moved <br/>
from that place.<br/>
<br/>
Perilam Pen<br/>
<br/>
448. The perilampen was a fortune<br/>
that Kama, the king of desire <br/>
who always wins the war of love<br/>
received because of the great austerities <br/>
he had performed<br/>
<br/>
449. For Kama she was like a commentary <br/>
on the book of love <br/>
that gives happiness to all.<br/>
She was a flood of love.<br/>
<br/>
450. She was as beautiful as Lakshmi <br/>
born in the ocean of milk.<br/>
Her smile was lovely.<br/>
Her face was as tender as a kumudam blossom.<br/>
She was thin and fragrant as a creeper.<br/>
<br/>
451. The perilampen was like<br/>
newly played music.<br/>
She was like a goddess <br/>
who gave beauty to the world.<br/>
<br/>
452. She was the drone sound <br/>
for the music that Kama plays.<br/>
She spread her knowledge everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
453. She came to see the procession <br/>
and even the goddess Lakshmi born <br/>
in the milky ocean<br/>
praised her lovely form.<br/>
<br/>
454. Her sharp eyes destroyed<br/>
the strength of the great ones.<br/>
They moved like a spear <br/>
a king raises to fight <br/>
his enemies.<br/>
455. They took away people’s lives <br/>
like the trident of the Lord <br/>
that kills his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
456. Kama who has a sugarcane bow <br/>
and a beautiful chariot and <br/>
Yama who carries <br/>
a spear in his strong hands <br/>
became her servants <br/>
because of the power <br/>
of her long sharp eyes.<br/>
<br/>
457. Her breasts were <br/>
decorated with garlands.<br/>
They were smeared <br/>
with fragrant sandal paste.<br/>
Beautiful ornaments studded <br/>
with diamonds covered them.<br/>
<br/>
458. Even though her breasts <br/>
were round and heavy <br/>
they did not pain her waist <br/>
so thin you could not even see it—<br/>
her breasts took care <br/>
that her waist not be hurt.<br/>
<br/>
459. She despised the ornaments on her arms <br/>
and her bracelets <br/>
because her arms and hands <br/>
wished to embrace the Lord <br/>
continually and lovingly <br/>
and she feared <br/>
they would hurt his body.<br/>
<br/>
460. She despised the jewels <br/>
on her body because <br/>
she thought that they were hiding <br/>
her lovely light color.<br/>
<br/>
461. She went to the marble mandapam <br/>
of the palace surrounded with high walls <br/>
that touched the dark clouds of the sky.<br/>
<br/>
462. She went happily <br/>
to the front part of the mandapam <br/>
<br/>
where the cool moon spread <br/>
its bright light like a flood of water.<br/>
<br/>
463. Her numerous friends resplendent with <br/>
their lovely golden faces <br/>
and long hair surrounded her <br/>
like many bees <br/>
swarming around a lotus blossom.<br/>
<br/>
464. Her golden earrings <br/>
studded with diamonds, <br/>
and her long beautiful eyes<br/>
moving like fish <br/>
touched her lovely ears <br/>
soft as Vallai creepers. <br/>
<br/>
465. The two breasts held by her tender waist <br/>
that one could not see <br/>
were like two growing buds <br/>
on the stalk of a lotus flower.<br/>
<br/>
466. Her neck was like beautiful conch<br/>
and her smile was like precious pearls.<br/>
Her clothes shimmered like waves.<br/>
<br/>
467. The porch looked like <br/>
a pond with waves <br/>
because of the bright <br/>
white moonlight <br/>
that fell there. <br/>
<br/>
468. She sat on a beautiful coral seat<br/>
like a swan resting on a red lotus <br/>
in a pond blooming with flowers.<br/>
<br/>
469. She praised the Lord to her friends<br/>
“The Lord is our friend.<br/>
He is incomparable.<br/>
He rules us.<br/>
<br/>
470. “If his devotees think <br/>
of the Lord when they are troubled, <br/>
our great Lord grants them <br/>
the fragrant lotus seat of Brahma, <br/>
the milky ocean of the gods <br/>
and the land of Indra with karpaga tree.<br/>
471. “Why did our great Lord makes the hot sun <br/>
take away the darkness of the night <br/>
instead of the moon?<br/>
Can you tell me the reason?”<br/>
<br/>
472. After the perilampen <br/>
said this to her friends, <br/>
a virali holding the yaaz <br/>
folded her lovely hands together, <br/>
bowed to her said, <br/>
<br/>
474, 475. “The Lord is compassionate.<br/>
He is the king of the kadamba forest.<br/>
His beautiful mouth is like a red lotus.<br/>
His shining teeth are like jasmine flowers.<br/>
His beautiful eyes are like sahoraa birds.<br/>
His arms are bright like the sun and moon.<br/>
You have the right to embrace his arms.
This what I must tell you”<br/>
<br/>
476. Hearing what the Virali said, <br/>
the perilampen replied, <br/>
“You are decorated with precious ornaments.<br/>
I would like to listen to the music <br/>
of your yaaz sweet as nectar.<br/>
Please play.”<br/>
<br/>
477. Taking the faultless tandiri yaaz <br/>
the virali played.<br/>
All the worlds hearing the music melted.<br/>
Listening to her music Gandarva women <br/>
in the sky were delighted. <br/>
The virali told the perilampen <br/>
miracle stories of Shiva.<br/>
<br/>
478. The story of Shiva<br/>
coming as a fisherman,<br/>
falling in love with a woman <br/>
who was born in a fisherman’s family<br/>
and marrying her.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
granting enlightenment <br/>
to Manickavaasagar.<br/>
<br/>
479. The story of Shiva, <br/>
selling foxes to the Pandya king, <br/>
telling him that they were horses,<br/>
and then asking him to release <br/>
Manickavaasagar who was imprisoned by him. <br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva <br/>
bringing a flood to the Vaikai river <br/>
one day.<br/>
<br/>
480. The story of Shiva<br/>
coming as a laborer and<br/>
working for Vanthi, an old lady,<br/>
to receive pittu, a sweet, as his wage.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva<br/>
curing the terrible disease <br/>
of the southern Pandya king.<br/>
<br/>
481. The story of Shiva<br/>
making the Jains to die <br/>
on sharp impaling stakes.<br/>
<br/>
The story of Shiva<br/>
bringing a Vanni tree and <br/>
a well to prove<br/>
the chastity of a merchant woman <br/>
who was a devotee of Shiva. <br/>
<br/>
482. The virali sang wonderful songs <br/>
about the miraculous deeds <br/>
of Lord Shiva in Tamil. <br/>
Her music was like a boat <br/>
that floated over the ocean of darkness <br/>
and brought travelers <br/>
to the bank where there is light.<br/>
<br/>
483, 484. As Lord Shiva came in procession <br/>
the darkness of the night dispersed. <br/>
All the roosters crowed in the morning<br/>
and the bees on the flowers buzzed.<br/>
Honey dripped from the blossoms.<br/>
The Rakshasas were destroyed.<br/>
Crops flourished.<br/>
The works of men flourished.<br/>
<br/>
485. The sun rising in the east <br/>
came on yoked horses spreading his light.<br/>
<br/>
486. Many strong elephants trumpeted <br/>
and beautiful conches <br/>
were blown.<br/>
487. The melodious music of the yaaz <br/>
and the eternal heavenly recitation of <br/>
Vedas sounded.<br/>
<br/>
488. All the suffering and the poverty of <br/>
the creatures of the world<br/>
were removed in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
489. The lotus-like faces <br/>
of the good people<br/>
and their flower-like <br/>
hearts that never know hatred <br/>
found joy.<br/>
<br/>
490. The lowly religions<br/>
that teach wrong doctrines <br/>
could no longer contend with truth.<br/>
Bounteous rays of knowledge<br/>
shone forth and imparted goodness.<br/>
<br/>
491. He is the Lord who grants the rays of knowledge <br/>
to all the world so that ignorance will disappear.<br/>
<br/>
492. He came on the streets of Maduraapuri <br/>
and reached the perilampen and her friends.<br/>
<br/>
493. Her friends were beautiful as dolls, <br/>
and they had the power to attract everyone.<br/>
<br/>
494. Surrounding her, her friends praised her.<br/>
She walked near the king of Maduraapuri<br/>
and worshipped him.<br/>
<br/>
495. The fascination she felt seeing the Lord<br/>
was indescribable. <br/>
<br/>
496. One of the perilampen’s friends <br/>
ran near the Lord, <br/>
who is the king <br/>
<br/>
of the scholars of elegant Tamil<br/>
and said,<br/>
<br/>
497. “We cannot understand<br/>
why the heat of the bright moon<br/>
makes our moon-like faces <br/>
and hearts suffer.<br/>
498. “We cannot understand <br/>
why our wide ocean-like eyes <br/>
suffer without sleep because <br/>
the ocean roars so loudly.<br/>
<br/>
499. “We cannot understand <br/>
why the sandal paste <br/>
on our breasts decorated <br/>
with pearl garlands<br/>
cannot dry.<br/>
<br/>
500. “How can I explain <br/>
the way my arms shiver <br/>
listening to the sound of the flute<br/>
as cruel as Yama.<br/>
<br/>
501. “If your procession crosses this street, <br/>
she will suffer terribly.”<br/>
Her friends said these things <br/>
to the Lord and bowed to him.<br/>
<br/>
502. The perilampen felt relieved <br/>
and her suffering was calmed.<br/>
She said to the Lord, <br/>
“You destroyed the pride of the gods who do not respect you.<br/>
You destroy the sacrifice of tyrannical Dakshan.<br/>
<br/>
503. ‘You burned Kama’s body. <br/>
You destroyed the garland of Indra,<br/>
crushing his arms.<br/>
<br/>
504. “You made the strength <br/>
of moonlight grow weak at night.<br/>
You have put out <br/>
the cruel fire of my passion.<br/>
<br/>
505. “You gave pain to those friends <br/>
who did not respect you.<br/>
<br/>
You cut off the head of Brahma<br/>
who decides the fate of everyone.<br/>
<br/>
506. “Yoga, they say, takes away the suffering of love.<br/>
Will you not calm <br/>
my suffering by giving me the power of yoga?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
507. “You gave your grace <br/>
to Sundarar who fell <br/>
in love with Paravaiyaar in Thiruvaarur.<br/>
You grant boons to gods and others.<br/>
<br/>
508. “You gave them all gold <br/>
so that they could survive.<br/>
But you only gave me pallor <br/>
that has the color of gold.<br/>
How am I to live?<br/>
<br/>
509. “The goddess embraces <br/>
your chest lovingly.<br/>
If you embrace us also, <br/>
the mark of her body <br/>

You will be born as a human being on earth.” Saraswathi asked her husband to forgive her and he said, “Your body is made of fifty-one letters.  Of those fifty-one, forty-eight will be born as poets in Kudal city and compose poetry. The chief poet will be the god Somasundarar himself. You will live in the hearts of those poets and give them power to compose poetry.”  This happened as Brahma had ordered, with Somasundarar being the forty-ninth poet.

He announced to the poets, “If any of you bring me a poem that will remove my doubt I will give him a thousand gold coins.” Many poets tried but none could help the king. There was a poor poet named Dharmi in Madurai and he went to the temple and prayed to Shiva to help him. Lord Somasundarar wrote a poem and gave it to the poor poet. Dharmi went to the king and read the poem. The king was happy and decided to give him the gold, but Nakkirar, a famous poet in the assembly objected that the meaning of the poem was not correct because women’s hair does not have  any natural fragrance, only the fragrance of oil and flowers that women wear in their hair. Dharmi went to the Shiva and the god came to the court of the Pandyan king and argued with Nakkirar. When Nakkirar realized that God himself wrote the poem he asked for forgiveness.

They prayed to Shiva to reveal to them who the best poets were.  Lord Shiva came to the Sangam disguised as a poet and told them, “There is a boy named Rudarasanman who is the son of Dhanapati and Gunasaalini. He is dumb and cannot speak. If you read your poems to him, he will tremble and shed tears when he hears a good poem. Then you will know who are the good poets.” The poets did as Shiva had asked, reading their poems and finding out whether they were good by Rudrasanman’s reaction. This took away their pride, and afterwards they worked hard to compose good poems. (55)<br/>
