<strong> 
1. Praise of the name of the lord ‘Nārāyaṇā’ <br/>
</strong> <br/>
948. I was born with sorrow. <br/>
I withered and suffered in life. <br/>
When I was young my only wish<br/>
was to love women and be with them.<br/>
I searched for a way to escape <br/>
from my desire for women and wandered everywhere.<br/>
I searched for the feeling that would lead me<br/>
to the highest state and found the name “Nārāyaṇa.”<br/>
<br/>
949. I thought of the round breasts of women <br/>
and melted to embrace them.<br/>
I told women, “You are my life. You are my nectar.”<br/>
How many days and how many ages <br/>
have been wasted since I, a sinner,<br/>
acted without realizing what I am doing.<br/>
I worshiped the god of Kuḍandai <br/>
surrounded with water <br/>
where swans with white feathers embrace their mates.<br/>
I praised him with my tongue,<br/>
discovered the name “Nārāyaṇa.”<br/>
and I am saved in this life itself.<br/>
<br/>
950. I desired only a happy life and gained bad karma.<br/>
I thought only of the beauty of women.<br/>
I was like a dumb person <br/>
and dreamed only of passion and wasted my days. <br/>
If devotees approach him, the father of Kāma, <br/>
he will go and stay in their minds. <br/>
I found the name “Nārāyaṇa”<br/>
and I am saved in this life itself. <br/>
<br/>
951. I wanted to be successful in everything.<br/>
I desired to have much wealth that would never be lost.<br/>
I thought only of being with women with spear-like eyes.<br/>
My heart is confused and my thoughts wanders everywhere.<br/>
What can I do? <br/>
You grew to the sky at the sacrifice of king Mahābali<br/>
and you took the form of a boar, went to the underworld<br/>
and brought back the earth goddess, stolen by an Asuran.<br/>
Through your grace <br/>
I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa” and am saved.<br/>
<br/>
952. I have been a thief and done many wrong things.<br/>
I wandered around as I wanted<br/>
but now my mind has found the truth.<br/>
When I discovered the right path that leads to him <br/>
at once I received his divine grace. <br/>
My heart melts and my voice grows weak.<br/>
As tears fall all over my body<br/>
all day until the middle of the dark night <br/>
I call out the divine name, “Nārāyaṇa!”<br/>
<br/>
953. My dear father is my kin, my king and my life, <br/>
frightened the Rakshasas and killed them with his arrows.<br/>
O devotees, worship the beautiful diamond-studded temple in Thanjai <br/>
surrounded with strong walls and blooming with fragrant groves.<br/>
O Nambis! I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa” and I am saved.<br/>
<br/>
954. O learned ones! <br/>
You praise the people in the world as you want, saying,<br/>
“This one is from a reputable family.<br/>
This one is famous. This one has good qualities. <br/>
This one is as generous as a Karpaga tree.”<br/>
Come and I will tell you something.<br/>
Go and worship the lord of Kuḍandai, surrounded with water,<br/>
and you will find the most excellent of things.<br/>
Sing and praise the name, “Nārāyaṇa” and you will be saved.<br/>
<br/>
955. I have not learned what is good for me.<br/>
I have thought only of the desires that my five senses bring.<br/>
Innocent, I have done no good deeds in my life.<br/>
I wandered around doing only evil to all <br/>
in this large world, but I have stopped that now. <br/>
I want to find a good way to save my life.<br/>
I, a slave of him, have found the name “Nārāyaṇa”<br/>
and I hold to him as my refuge.<br/>
<br/>
956. The name “Nārāyaṇa” will give a good family<br/>
to his devotees and remove all their troubles.<br/>
It will give them the highest place in heaven.<br/>
It will his grace that leads them to moksha. <br/>
It will give strength and all goodness.<br/>
It will do all the things that a mother does for her children. <br/>
I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa”<br/>
and it will give me good life. <br/>
<br/>
957. O devotees, when you are in trouble or at the end of your life, <br/>
think of Thirumangai surrounded by ponds<br/>
with abundant water where groves swarm with bees <br/>
and clouds float above the tall trees<br/>
and worship him with a garland of divine pāsurams composed by Kaliyan.<br/>
Say the name “Nārāyaṇa” and he will remove the results of your karma.<br/>

the small foreheads, round arms, beautiful breasts <br/>
and shining moon-like smiles of lovely women.<br/>
I understand now that I was weak and what I did was wrong.<br/>
I am ashamed that I wanted to be with young women.<br/>
I know this birth is a sickness<br/>
and I do not want to be born again.<br/>
O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.<br/>
I have approached your divine feet <br/>
and you are my refuge.<br/>
<br/>
999. I have always enjoyed women <br/>
with long dark eyes, beautiful figures<br/>
and feet ornamented with anklets. <br/>
I forgot dharma, enjoyed the bliss that my five senses gave<br/>
and wasted my life.<br/>
Your generous hands give whatever your devotees ask of you.<br/>
You are a cowherd. You are a Māyan.<br/>
You are the king of the gods in the sky,<br/>
and they worship you and ask your grace.<br/>
O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.<br/>
I have approached your divine feet <br/>
and you are my refuge.<br/>
<br/>
1000. I gambled and stole things from others.<br/>
I loved beautiful curly-headed women.<br/>
I wandered all over wherever I wished and wasted my life. <br/>
Now I have become your devotee and shiver when I think<br/>
of the troubles that Yama’s messengers will bring.<br/>
O lord who churned the milky ocean roaring with white waves,<br/>
my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.<br/>
I have approached your divine feet, my refuge. <br/>
<br/>
1001. Someone may leave his wife <br/>
with fragrant hair swarming with bees<br/>
and love someone else’s wife and wealth <br/>
and believe in that kind of life. <br/>
When he dies and goes to Yama’s world, <br/>
Yama’s messengers will tell him, <br/>
“Embrace this burning copper doll, you sinner!”<br/>
I am afraid of the thought that I will be like that. <br/>
You are my friend.<br/>
O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.<br/>
I have approached your divine feet <br/>
and you are my refuge.<br/>
<br/>
1002. When people suffering in poverty came to me <br/>
and asked me, “Please give me a little bit of food,” <br/>
I was unkind and told them cruelly, <br/>
“No. I have no food!” and refused them.<br/>
What a pity that was.<br/>
I have not thought of the results of my bad deeds. <br/>
I am afraid that when Yama’s messengers come for me,<br/>
they will say cruel things and make me suffer. <br/>
I shiver and have come to your divine feet. <br/>
O father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam<br/>
and you are my refuge. <br/>
<br/>
1003. With a crooked mind I did evil things.<br/>
I wandered around, associated with people like dogs,<br/>
became weak, ran about and destroyed many lives. <br/>
I didn’t feel bad at all.<br/>
I didn’t think of what will happen to me in the world of Yama.<br/>
O highest lord resting on the milky ocean,<br/>
I searched for you and came to your divine feet.<br/>
You are my refuge. You are my father<br/>
and you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam. <br/>
<br/>
1004. In my mind I thought only of unjust deeds<br/>
and did them without any fear, speaking bad words. <br/>
When I listened to the timeless advice of the elders, and sages, I trembled. <br/>
I am a cheater, yet I am your slave.<br/>
You, the god of the sky who are poison to the Rāksasas<br/>
never leave the minds of your devotees.<br/>
O my father, god of Naimeesāraṇyam,<br/>
I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.<br/>
<br/>
1005. Kali, the god of time, <br/>
told the five senses to come to me <br/>
and make me surrender to the pleasures they offered . <br/>
Now I have been destroyed by the trouble that they cause me.<br/>
You have the dark color of the wide ocean <br/>
and stay in Thirukkuṛungudi. <br/>
I have worshiped you with sweet words and flowers<br/>
and praised you with my tongue. <br/>
O my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam,<br/>
I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.<br/>
<br/>
1006. This body is made of bones, <br/>
covered with flesh, skin and hair that are like walls. <br/>
It has nine openings and it is like a little hut.<br/>
When I depart from this body, <br/>
I will think only of you as my refuge. <br/>
You are the beloved of the goddess Malarmagaḷ<br/>
seated on a lotus dripping with honey<br/>
and you rest with her on the wide ocean rolling with waves. <br/>
I have done difficult tapas to reach you.<br/>
O my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam,<br/>
I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge. <br/>
<br/>
1007. Kaliyan loved, worshiped and composed these pāsurams<br/>
praising the god of Naimeesāraṇyam<br/>
where Indra the king of the gods<br/>
came with the other gods, worshiped our father<br/>
and asked him to remove their troubles. <br/>
If devotees learn and recite these ten poems <br/>
they will rule the world surrounded by sounding oceans<br/>
under a white umbrella and become gods.<br/>

while Shiva, burner of the three forts, and Nānmuhan on the lotus<br/>

‘Did the god of Thiruvarangam come to me? Won’t he come to me?’<br/>

and worshiped by the sages who make sacrifices with five types of fire.<br/>
He is praised in the Taittiriya Upanishad and in the Sāma Veda.<br/>
O my dear ones, he came to see my daughter <br/>

surrounded with strong walls<br/>
came to me and made my heart joyful. <br/>

Do you think this worship will become a habit for us?”<br/>

let them gossip about me as they wish.<br/>

<br/>
1790. She says,<br/>
“The morning brings me the pain of love just like the evening,<br/>
and the night only makes it greater, lasting as long as an eon.<br/>
If I try to describe the cold wind <br/>
I can only say it hurts me like a rising fire. <br/>
There are many tricks that the beautiful sapphire-colored Thirumāl can do.<br/>
Before he does something and hurts me,<br/>
take me to Thirukkuṛunguḍi<br/>
filled with forests where beautiful peacocks dance.”<br/>
<br/>

I am not shy, naive or afraid. <br/>
They may make themselves happy saying things about me,<br/>

“A tall dark god with beautiful eyes entered here. <br/>
He made my body weak and my bangles loose. <br/>
I wonder, ‘Why is this happening to me?’<br/>
The tricks of Kāma who carries a bow<br/>
with five flower arrows make me suffer from love.<br/>

Take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi<br/>
surrounded with forests and cool fields <br/>
blooming with flowers that drip honey.”<br/>
<br/>
1795. She says,<br/>
“Listen, it is not only the sound of the ocean that hurts me,<br/>
or the hands that are like ambal flowers<br/>
of the cowherd that come and pain my life. <br/>
Kāma may come and shoot his five flower arrows at me. <br/>
Before that happens,<br/>
find out what the dancer, the cowherd, thinks<br/>
and take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi.” <br/>
<br/>
1796. She says, <br/>
“Even though I praised him and worshiped him, he doesn’t take pity on me. <br/>
He took my chastity, gave me golden clothes to cover myself<br/>
and left, I don’t know where.<br/>
My breasts have grown out but they are no use <br/>
because he doesn’t embrace me.<br/>
He, a dancer and king of the gods,<br/>
wishes to stay in Thirukuṛunguḍi.<br/>
Take me there and leave me where he is.”<br/>
<br/>
1797. She says, <br/>
“The god of the gods who keeps the goddess Lakshmi with him,<br/>
the generous lord who destroyed southern Lanka,<br/>

</strong> <br/>
1908. Yashoda says, <br/>
“Our cowherd clan is respected by all.<br/>
If my son does something wrong, <br/>
I can only upbraid him gently, saying, <br/>
‘You shouldn’t hurt other children.’<br/>
I can’t scold him.<br/>
His father Nandan won’t say anything either.<br/>
O young friend, what can I do?<br/>
It seems he goes to the corner house on this street <br/>
to churn yogurt with a young girl.”<br/>
<br/>
1909. A cowherdess says,<br/>
“O dear Yashoda! I got up early<br/>
and went to sell the churned buttermilk,<br/>
looking for people to buy it,<br/>
but I didn’t see anyone except the son of Nandan<br/>
with hair that was decorated with fragrant flowers. <br/>
Come and look, my beautiful friend <br/>
from the last house on the street.<br/>
I don’t see the butter and the ten pots of milk that I had,<br/>
and I’m worried.<br/>
What should I do? What should I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1910. A cowherd woman says,<br/>
“O lovely Yashoda,<br/>
he is a little boy and he smiles sweetly. <br/>
I keep a pot full of butter in the uri,<br/>
but he has grabbed and swallowed it all, <br/>
as much as a silver hill. <br/>
He is a thief. Come and see him as he sleeps.<br/>
All his hands are smeared with butter.<br/>
His stomach is big enough to hold all the seven worlds,<br/>
so it isn’t hard for him to keep all that butter in his stomach.<br/>
I am ignorant! What can I do? What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1911. A cowherd woman says, <br/>
“Balaraman was born to a mother<br/>
with spear-like eyes that were darkened with kohl.<br/>
He and his brother Kaṇṇan were raised in the cowherd village together,<br/>
but he doesn’t do naughty things like Kaṇṇan.<br/>
Kaṇṇan tells lies, steals things <br/>
and crawls and acts as if he knew nothing about it. <br/>
Is he really a sweet child? <br/>
We cowherd women cannot escape his tricks.<br/>
What can I do? What can I do? ”<br/>
<br/>
1912. A cowherd woman says, <br/>
“One day before his father had returned,<br/>
when I wasn’t at home and my friends weren’t around,<br/>
he went near where my girl was playing,<br/>
her fragrant hair decorated with beautiful flowers,<br/>
and grabbed the ball she was playing with<br/>
and took her clothes and did naughty things.<br/>
What wrong have we done to Nandan’s son?<br/>
O, friend, what can I do? What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1913. A cowherdess says, <br/>
“ O Yashoda, our lord who was carried to our cowherd village <br/>
by his father Nandan at night when he was a child<br/>
is the beloved of Lakshmi and of the earth goddess. <br/>
He plays a bamboo flute and my daughter loves him. <br/>
Her flower-like eyes are weary, her breasts are round, <br/>
and her lotus-red mouth has grown pale.<br/>
O beautiful friend, come and see how my daughter suffers. <br/>
What can I do? What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1914. A cowherd woman says,<br/>
“The cowherds celebrated a festival <br/>
and offered many kinds of food for the thousand-eyed Indra. <br/>
O friend Yashoda, your son, disguised as a bhudam, <br/>
went there today and grabbed all the food and ate it. <br/>
See, it seems he is the Māyan<br/>
who took all the food and swallowed it.”<br/>
<br/>
1915. Yashoda says, <br/>
“The cowherd women got together and called me. <br/>
They said, ‘See, we kept the fermented yogurt,<br/>
fragrant ghee and milk in various pots, <br/>
but they are all empty now.’<br/>
I felt ashamed and told my friends, <br/>
‘He is my dear lord! <br/>
I can only plead with him not to do these naughty things,<br/>
I can’t scold him.<br/>
How could I scold my child <br/>
who drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her? <br/>
I am afraid of scolding him.’”<br/>
<br/>
1916. Yashoda says, <br/>
“Seven months after my dear son was born, <br/>
when I had put my strong, matchless child <br/>
to sleep on a bed soft as a flower<br/>
and gone to bathe in the Yamuna river,<br/>
he killed Sakaṭāsuran with his divine feet <br/>
when he came as a cart that was large as a mountain.<br/>
He rests on Adisesha on the ocean<br/>
and Lakshmi stays on his faultless chest.<br/>
I am afraid of scolding him after he did such a heroic deed.”<br/>
<br/>
1917. Yashoda says, <br/>
“O beautiful friends, I am afraid even of calling him by name.<br/>
Even if the young children with soft, cotton-like feet<br/>
eat a thousand measures of ghee, <br/>
my friends, their mothers, do not scold them. <br/>
You are the best among men! <br/>
You killed Kamsan, the terrible Asuran <br/>
on the day I was supposed to pay him money<br/>
for the loan I took from him.<br/>
I am not as strong as you, O Nambi.<br/>
Do whatever you want.<br/>
What can I do? What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1918. Yashoda says to Kaṇṇan, <br/>
“ O lovely one! How could you do these naughty things?<br/>
O Nambi, you hid and went behind the beautiful cowherd girls <br/>
when they bathed in the pond where lotuses bloom<br/>
and stole their fine clothes and climbed up a tree.<br/>
When the lovely-waisted girls begged you for their clothes,<br/>
you said, ‘Come, beautiful ones, come and take them from me,’<br/>
and you stayed in the tree.”<br/>
<br/>
1919. Yashoda says, <br/>
“This child has no fear,<br/>
even to the extent of a tiny millet seed.<br/>
I raised him with manliness and braveness.<br/>
I kissed him and gave him lots of love. I have never scolded him,<br/>
but now he never tells me anything he does.<br/>
He climbed on the blooming green Kaḍamba tree,<br/>
jumped into the pond and fought and killed Kālingan,<br/>
the snake that has a thousand poisonous tongues. <br/>
Now he has come back. How can I scold him?”<br/>
<br/>
1920. Yashoda says, <br/>
“O my lord, do great people do things that are not suitable?<br/>
I gave birth to you. What can I do?<br/>
You fought with Arishṭāsuran when he came as a bull<br/>
from the fragrant forest where he lived <br/>
bellowing like thunder and shaking all the seven worlds,<br/>
as his eyes angry eyes looked like hot fire.<br/>
It seems that you killed him and have come back home.”<br/>
<br/>
1921. Kaliyan the chief of rich lovely Thirumangai<br/>
surrounded with strong walls and the wide ocean <br/>
composed fourteen sweet musical pāsurams on the lord<br/>
who killed the angry elephant Kuvalayābeedam as large as a mountain. <br/>
The poet describes how the cowherdess Yasodha, <br/>
her walk as gentle as a swan’s, worries about him. <br/>
If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams<br/>
they will have no troubles in life.<br/>

you come here now and stand behind me.<br/>

What do you want? What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>

“You, matchless, carry an eagle banner<br/>
and you killed Sakāṭāsuran when he came as a cart,<br/>

What are you doing in the night like this?<br/>
What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1925. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,<br/>
“You are the sweet Nāraṇan with many names adorned with thulasi garlands.<br/>
You come like Kāma, the god of love, sing songs <br/>
and enter our homes.<br/>
Why are you doing this in the middle of the night?<br/>
What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1926. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.<br/>
“Your hair is long and curly, you carry a small sword<br/>
 and you are adorned with many golden ornaments<br/>
studded with beautiful diamonds.<br/>
You have come into our front yard<br/>
and you smile and just stand there.<br/>
Why do you do this? What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1927. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.<br/>
“You left the cowherds and their cows, <br/>
carrying a curved victorious bow, <br/>
and now you look to see if anyone is around <br/>
and enter our homes when no one is there. <br/>
Why are you doing this where others might see?<br/>
What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1928. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,<br/>
“You, our beloved, fought the wrestlers with your strong arms.<br/>
Last night we already knew what you wanted.<br/>
You always go away without telling us when you will come back,<br/>
and if you do tell us, you never come when you said you would.<br/>
O god! What is this? What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1929. A cowherd says to Kaṇṇan<br/>
“You are faultless. <br/>
You entered a pond, caught the snake Kālingan<br/>
and danced on his heads.<br/>
You don’t think we’re as important to you as you used to—<br/>
you have many good girlfriends. <br/>
O god! What is this? What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1930. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.<br/>
“You are a handsome young man.<br/>
The goddess of wealth Lakshmi<br/>
and the earth goddess stay with you,<br/>
but you join the beautiful cowherd girls<br/>
and dance the kuravai dance with them. <br/>
O my friend, do you see this?<br/>
What is this? What is this? What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1931. Kaliyan who has strong mountain-like arms <br/>
composed a garland of pāsurams<br/>
describing how the cowherd girls, <br/>
quarrel during the day with lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams and worship the god<br/>
they will have no sorrow in their lives. <br/>

<strong>  99. Her mother śays<br/>
</strong> <br/>
1932. Her mother says, <br/>
“You, the heroic lord, burnt Lanka<br/>
and you drank the milk of the devil Putana<br/>
when she came in the middle of the night and killed her. <br/>
Our young girls decorated with flowers dripping with honey love you, <br/>
but you ignore their love and don’t care about them— <br/>
you’re just like the mothers who take away a cup of milk <br/>
from their children’s hands whenever they want <br/>
and don’t worry about it.<br/>
What can I say about you?”<br/>
<br/>
 1933. Her mother says, <br/>
“You, the ocean-colored lord of Thirumalai,<br/>
danced the kuthu dance in the middle of the village, <br/>
you subdued the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai, <br/>
and you protected the terrified cowherds and the cows<br/>
from the storm with Govardhana mountain.<br/>
When you made my daughter’s bangles grow loose and fall, <br/>
you did it as if you were taking honey from the murungai tree<br/>
that is in the front of your temple. <br/>
Is this because you have so much strength from your heroic deeds?”<br/>
<br/>
1934. Her mother says, <br/>
“ O lovely god, you have the color of a dark cloud,<br/>
and the mighty discus and conch you carry in your hands <br/>
make you even more heroic. <br/>
My dear daughter who is precious as a garland of pearls<br/>
is adorned with beautiful ornaments.<br/>
She is as sweet as the nectar from the large ocean.<br/>
You think that she is like a sweet ball of jaggery in your hands.<br/>
Is this because you are heroic and conquered Kamsan?” <br/>
<br/>
1935. Her mother says,<br/>
“You gave part of your body to Shiva<br/>
who has round arms and wears a deer skin.<br/>
Your strong hands killed Narakāsuran.<br/>
You have stolen the beautiful color of my daughter<br/>
whose hair is decorated with alli garlands.<br/>
You stand in front of her always and don’t go away.<br/>
What can I say? O Nambi, you seem to think she is like a stick <br/>
in the hands of your servants. What can I say?”<br/>
<br/>
1936. Her mother says, <br/>
“Alas, you don’t think of the beauty<br/>
of my daughter who speaks sweetly<br/>
and whose hair is decorated with garlands that drip honey. <br/>
You say she is not even as good as a berry fruit lying on a path.<br/>
I don’t understand.<br/>
Is it because you are heroic and rode on a chariot <br/>
and destroyed the pride of the kings in Bharatha war,<br/>
sending them on the path to the sky?”<br/>
<br/>
1937. Her mother says, <br/>
“What is this you are doing now?<br/>
You made the white conch bangles of my daughter grow loose<br/>
whose mouth is as red as the petals of a murukkam flower,<br/>
and you stand in front of her and don’t leave.<br/>
Is that because with your bow <br/>
you destroyed the pride of the king of Lanka <br/>
surrounded with beautiful forts and made the gods serve you?<br/>
O father! Why should anyone need to throw an axe<br/>
just to make an erukkam leaf fall?”<br/>
<br/>
1938. Her mother says, <br/>
“O lord, you are our father with the color of the large ocean.<br/>
You stole the shining color of my daughter<br/>
whose glance is as soft as a doe’s,<br/>
and you keep standing in front of her always, not going away.<br/>
Why should anyone need to use even a small stick<br/>
to make an egg break for the chick to emerge?<br/>
Do you do these things because you are heroic<br/>
and used your axe to cut off the thousand strong arms of Bānāsuran<br/>
who ruled the world surrounded by oceans,<br/>
making many kings riding strong chariots with lovely wheels<br/>
come and obey him?”<br/>
<br/>
1939. Her mother says, <br/>
“You, colored like the dark ocean,<br/>
have not thought of the pride of my daughter<br/>
whose eyes are beautiful<br/>
and whose garlanded hair swarms with bees.<br/>
Why did you do this?<br/>
It is because you are proud that you split open<br/>
the chest of Hiranyan, your enemy,<br/>
and because you became angry at Vāli and killed him <br/>
when you felt compassion for Sugreeva? <br/>
Do you think my daughter is only like the moisture <br/>
that comes inside your mouth in your cheek?”<br/>
<br/>
1940. Her mother says, <br/>
“Are you proud because you are water, fire, sky, <br/>
the large world and wind?<br/>
Or do you think that my daughter <br/>
with a beautiful garland in her hair has no one but you?<br/>
I have done bad karma.<br/>
My daughter is as precious as the nectar <br/>
that came from the milky ocean. <br/>
Do you think she is like the garden of a Vediyan<br/>
who gives his attention only to making his sacrificial fire<br/>
and gives no care to anything else?”<br/>
<br/>
1941. Kaliyan the chief of Thirumangai<br/>
with a spear in his hand<br/>
overcame his desires for the world<br/>
and worshiped the feet of the god truly<br/>
and the lord gave his grace to him.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams<br/>
that praise the lord who is adorned<br/>
with fresh thulasi garlands with opening buds, <br/>
their devotion and wealth will increase. <br/>

should come. The rooster crows.”<br/>
<br/>
1948. She says, <br/>
“What can I do to stop Kāma,<br/>
who has shot five flower arrows into my heart and hurt me?<br/>
I was already suffering because of the love I have<br/>
for the dark cloud-colored god. <br/>
What can I do to stop Kāma <br/>
who makes my love for Kaṇṇan grow?” <br/>
<br/>
1949. She says, <br/>
“Will the god Māl who lies on Adisesha <br/>
in Thirukkudanthai surrounded with groves <br/>
dripping with honey come here<br/>
so that my long sharp spear-like eyes <br/>
can see him and be happy? Will he come?”<br/>
<br/>
1950. She says, <br/>
“O mother, I don’t know who he is.<br/>
He carries a discus and a beautiful golden bow. <br/>
I don’t know who he is.”<br/>
<br/>
1951. O devotees, sing.<br/>
Sing the Tamil garland of pāsurams <br/>
that Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai <br/>
surrounded with groves swarming with bees, <br/>
who wears a beautiful garland and carries a spear,<br/>
composed on the lord.<br/>
Sing, O devotees. <br/>

</strong> <br/>
1952. She says, <br/>
“Our divine god protected the cows and cowherds<br/>
from the storm by carrying Govardhana mountain.<br/>
Heroic, he fought with the Rākshasas with his victorious bow<br/>
and defeated them.<br/>
Does the breeze blow on me as if it were fire<br/>
because I think of his heroic deeds? What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1953. She says, <br/>
“The cold wind hurts me<br/>
as the dark clouds pour down drops of rain.<br/>
Am I being punished <br/>
because I long to see the chest and the garlands <br/>
of the dark god colored like a cloud or the ocean? What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1954. She says, <br/>
“With its rays the moon is angry with me<br/>
and makes my pale body weak. <br/>
My conch bangles become loose. What can I do?<br/>
He has the color of the ocean that rises with white waves.<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
His thulasi garland with blooming flowers <br/>
that drip honey calls to me.” <br/>
<br/>
1955. She says, <br/>
“He were taken to the clan<br/>
of the cowherd village and raised there.<br/>
When Putana came as a mother<br/>
he drank milk from her breasts and killed her.<br/>
Do the rays of the moon burn so hot <br/>
because I think of his heroic deeds?”<br/>
<br/>
1956. She says, <br/>
“He took the form of a man-lion<br/>
and split the chest of Hiraṇyan in two.<br/>
Does the ocean cry in its loneliness <br/>
because it wants to have the bright moon <br/>
that the god makes wane to darkness?”<br/>
<br/>
1957. She says,<br/>
“He went to Lanka, bent his victorious bow <br/>
and fought with the Rākshasas. <br/>
On the palm tree, the andril bird<br/>
in its nest made of lotuses coos and hurts me<br/>
because I think of the heroic deeds of the lord.” <br/>
<br/>
1958. She says, <br/>
“Kāma comes carrying five flower arrows, <br/>
shoots them at me without stopping <br/>
and makes me suffer.<br/>
Am I being punished <br/>
because I saw the lord as dark as a kāyām flower<br/>
when he came on Garuḍa<br/>
and fell in love with him?”<br/>
<br/>
1959. She says, <br/>
“When the thought of the thulasi garland<br/>
that adorns him entered my heart, <br/>
it came along with the lovely, cool wind<br/>
dripping with drops of rain. <br/>
It will be very hard for my life to be saved.” <br/>
<br/>
1960. She says,<br/>
“If bees bring and spread the fragrance <br/>
of the beautiful fresh thulasi garland <br/>
that devotees use to decorate him,<br/>
my eyes that are like kendai fish will close in sleep<br/>
and the pale color of my body will change <br/>
to the brightness it had before.” <br/>
<br/>
1961. Kaliyan, the famous chief<br/>
who carries a sword and is praised by all in Thirumangai<br/>
composed pāsurams on our beautiful-eyed Māyan<br/>
who went as a messenger<br/>

If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will have no trouble in life.<br/>
--------------<br/><br/>

</strong> <br/>
1962. She says, <br/>
“The lord who carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella<br/>
and blocked the storm, saving the cows and the cowherds,<br/>
and who danced the Kuravai dance with young girls in the mandram <br/>
has enchanted me.<br/>
The andril bird on the palm tree in the front yard coos and hurts me.<br/>
Who can remove its nest so it will not coo and call its absent mate?”<br/>
<br/>
1963. She says,<br/>
“The heroic Kaṇṇan who shattered the blooming Kurundam trees,<br/>
and broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam<br/>
fought with the Asuran who came as a horse,<br/>
took the form of a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan,<br/>
and drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her.<br/>
When Kaṇṇan is with me what can the music <br/>
of the bamboo flute of a cowherd do to my youth?”<br/>
<br/>
1964. She says, <br/>
“The dark sapphire-colored lord fought the wrestlers sent by Kamsan<br/>
and conquered Kamsan and killed him.<br/>
I think always of his cool thulasi garlands strung with alli flowers.<br/>
The breeze comes and torments me in the evening<br/>
and the bells of the strong bulls returning from the fields give me pain.”<br/>
<br/>
1965. She says, <br/>
“The faultless lord shot his arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees.<br/>
Whenever I think of his divine feet, <br/>
the sound of the cool dark ocean that roars all night <br/>
and the cold wind that blows make me suffer. What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
1966. She says,<br/>
“My mother scolds me.<br/>
The calling of the andril bird makes me sick with love.<br/>
The waves of the ocean roar and my bangles grow loose.<br/>
These things have happened <br/>
only since I fell in love with the beloved of Nappinnai <br/>
whose waist is adorned with golden clothes and who walks softly like a swan <br/>
with hair decorated with beautiful flowers.”<br/>
<br/>
1967. She says, <br/>
“The lord who carries a discus and a conch <br/>
came to me in a dream and made me love him.<br/>
Except me and my friend, the whole world is sleeping.<br/>
The rooster has not crowed yet and it is very dark.”<br/>
<br/>
1968. She says, <br/>
“It is not fair that Kāma<br/>
who is no relative of mine causes me pain,<br/>
yet the ocean-colored god is my beloved<br/>
and if Kāma is his son, he is also my son.<br/>
He shoots the fire of love at me every night<br/>
and my young breasts swell out <br/>
loving the precious sapphire-colored lord.”<br/>
<br/>
1969. She says, <br/>
“The beloved god of Thirumalirunjolai <br/>
where the clouds float high<br/>
took my chastity and my heart and went away. <br/>
He hasn’t thought of me at all after that.<br/>
It is dawn yet?<br/>
Where does the hot sun go and hide?<br/>
Wouldn’t it be better if my suffering body could sleep?” <br/>
<br/>
1970. She says, <br/>
“O friend, Kāma shoots his arrows and makes us suffer.<br/>
We shouldn’t think that we are just women and that we are weak.<br/>
We should carry pure water and flowers and go where he stays.<br/>
If we worship and praise him, <br/>
won’t we be able to see the dark cloud-colored god with our eyes?”<br/>
<br/>
1971. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai praised by all,<br/>
composed ten pāsurams on the victorious lord <br/>
who fought and killed the seven heroic bulls.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will not experience the results of their karma in this world. <br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>  103. She says. <br/>
</strong> <br/>
1972. She says, <br/>
“He drove a shining chariot in the Bharatha war<br/>
and he measured the world in three footsteps at Mahābali’s sacrifice. <br/>
He fought with the Rākshasas and destroyed the pride of Lanka.<br/>
See, my conch bangles have grown loose <br/>
and I have lost my beauty because I love him. <br/>
<br/>
1973. She says, <br/>
“He stays in my heart. <br/>
When the elephant Gajendra with huge legs was caught by a crocodile, <br/>
he came and saved him and gave him his grace.<br/>
I sing and dance, praising the names of broad-armed Neḍumal<br/>
and my breasts do not grow slack or lose their bright color.<br/>
What is this?”<br/>
<br/>
1974. She says, <br/>
“He saved all the four Vedas and taught them to the sages. <br/>
He came to me, made my precious golden bangles loose,<br/>
entered my heart and stayed there, without leaving.<br/>
What is this? I don’t understand what he is thinking.<br/>
<br/>
1975. The lord who was born as a little child and toddled <br/>
stole fragrant ghee from the uṛi and ate it happily.<br/>
He stays in beautiful Thirukkuḍanthai <br/>
surrounded with fragrant groves. <br/>
How could I say I don’t know him?<br/>
<br/>
1976. If devotees bow to him and worship him every day<br/>
he gives his grace to them<br/>
and so we also bow and worship the lord<br/>
and keep him in our mind as our refuge. <br/>
<br/>
1977. Kaṇṇan measured the world with one foot<br/>
and the sky with the other <br/>
and his devotees keep his feet in their hearts. <br/>
The gods in the sky worship him folding their lotus hands. <br/>
<br/>
1978. Kaṇṇan is in my mind.<br/>
Is it his māyam that makes the bangles on my arms grow loose?<br/>
Is this because we are women and have the nature of women?<br/>
We sing and praise the Thiruvenkaṭam hills of the lord and his Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
1979. O good heart, we want go join him. <br/>
Let us dance and sing the praise of our dear lord.<br/>
Let us think of the thousand-named god<br/>
and let us wear his thulasi garland. <br/>
<br/>
1980. O good heart! <br/>
Let us fold our hands and worship him<br/>
who stays happily in Thiruvāli<br/>
where swans wander on the seashore <br/>
so that our bad karma will go away,<br/>
and let us wear flowers from the divine golden feet<br/>
of the lord who has the color of a cloud. <br/>
<br/>
1981. Kaliyan the poet composed ten Tamil musical pāsurams <br/>
on the lord who has a thousand names.<br/>
If devotees learn these names, <br/>
they will rule all the three worlds. <br/>
They who hear these pāsurams will live<br/>
without any troubles in this world. <br/>
-----------<br/><br/>
<strong>  104. </strong> <br/>
1982. When the world was inundated by a terrible flood <br/>
and the waves of the ocean rose<br/>
and the water flowed everywhere<br/>
and people had no place to go,<br/>
the gods in the sky went to the lord and said,<br/>
“There is no refuge for us,”<br/>
and Thirumāl took the form of a fish,<br/>
carried all the mountains on his back and saved all. <br/>
Worship him, O my heart, do not forget him.<br/>
<br/>
1983. As a turtle he supported Mandara mountain on his back<br/>
and using it as a churning stick and the snake Vasuki as a rope<br/>
he churned the milky ocean <br/>
while all the gods in the sky helped him.<br/>
That Thirumāl is our refuge. <br/>
<br/>
1984. He is the ancient god who, at the end of the eon,<br/>
became a boar and saved everything from the flood—<br/>
the worlds of the gods and all the seven worlds <br/>
where the faultless moon and the sun shine, <br/>
and all mountains and rivers of the earth, and the seven oceans.<br/>
Containing all the worlds and the oceans <br/>
in the vessel that he carried on his foot,<br/>
he protected us. He is our ruler. <br/>
<br/>
1985. As a man-lion he went to Hiraṇyan<br/>
and with heroic fiery eyes and his garland hanging down by his arms, <br/>
he angrily split open the Rākshasa’s chest with his sharp claws.<br/>
His heroism is greater than the large oceans <br/>
that surround all the three worlds.<br/>
<br/>
1986. He took the form of a dwarf-sage<br/>
and went to the heroic king Mahābali’s sacrifice,<br/>
reciting the Vedas as one who knows the truth. <br/>
When he asked for three feet of land from the king, <br/>
the king granted his wish, and he grew tall<br/>
and measured the sky with one foot and the earth with the other.<br/>
Let the feet of that king who measured the seven worlds and the sky rule us.<br/>
<br/>
1987. As heroic Parasuraman, he fought with his axe<br/>
and defeated the twice eight and four kings of the world.<br/>
The lord who swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out<br/>
is the beloved the earth goddess, of Lakshmi and of Nappinnai.<br/>
He rules us happily. <br/>
<br/>
1988. As Rama in the forest, he chased the Rākshasa Marisan<br/>
who came as a golden deer to delight Sita<br/>
whose sharp eyes were like spears, and he killed it.<br/>
When Sita was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa<br/>
he went to Lanka, killed the Rākshasas, shattered Lanka into pieces, <br/>
and, shooting his powerful arrows with his bow, defeated Rāvaṇa.<br/>
He, our Thirumāl, is our refuge. <br/>
<br/>
1989. The world grew dark at the end of the eon in ancient times.<br/>
The divine Vedas disappeared<br/>
and the gods were shocked and did not know<br/>
where their worlds had gone.<br/>
He took the form of a swan, <br/>
removed the darkness of the world and taught the Vedas to the sages <br/>
and removed the ignorance of the world. <br/>
The lord always gives his grace to the gods and all others.<br/>
<br/>
1990. O devotees, do not think there are other ways<br/>
you can be helped and that you do not need him.<br/>
Worship the lord who drank the milk from the breasts of Putana and killed her.<br/>
When he stole butter from the cowherd women and ate it,<br/>
round-breasted Yashoda tied him to a mortar,<br/>
but he pulled the mortar after him and walked between two marudu trees<br/>
and knocked them down, killing the two Rākshasas who had taken their form.<br/>
He is our refuge and he takes away the results of our bad karma. <br/>

shooting mighty arrows from his bow.<br/>

they will go to the world of the gods and rule there.<br/>
-----------<br/><br/>
<strong>  105. Thiruchāzhal <br/>
</strong> <br/>
1992. O friend, see, he went on a path filled with stones <br/>
and lived in the forest with his wife Vaidehi with soft doe like eyes..<br/>
The gods from the sky bowed with their heads <br/>
adorned with garlands and worshiped<br/>
the golden feet of Rama when he walked in the forest. Say sāzhale. <br/>
<br/>
1993. O friend, see!<br/>
After he was born he released his father Vasudeva<br/>
from the chains that bound his ankles<br/>
and Nandan, the cowherd chief, took him as a baby to his village<br/>
where he was raised as Nandan’s son. <br/>
He is our dear lord, the father of Nānmuhan, sāzhale.<br/>
<br/>
1994. O friend, see!<br/>
He was raised as a cowherd among people<br/>
who did not know he was the lord.<br/>
He ate happily all the fragrant butter <br/>
that the long-haired cowherd women of the village churned and kept.<br/>
His golden stomach that swallowed all the seven worlds<br/>
surrounded by the deep ocean <br/>
had still more room to eat the butter from the uri. Sāzhale.<br/>
<br/>
1995. O friend, see!<br/>
He was raised as a cowherd among the innocent cowherds of the village <br/>
and ate and relished the fragrant butter that was kept in the uri,<br/>
but his stomach was still not full and he swallowed all the worlds <br/>
surrounded by the oceans with rolling waves. Sāzhale.<br/>
<br/>
1996. O friend, see! The beautiful dark-haired cowherd women <br/>
hit him with a churning stick and tied him up with a small rope,<br/>
but though he was tied up,<br/>
even the gods of the sky could not know who he is. Sāzhale.<br/>
<br/>
1997. O friend, see!<br/>
He danced the marakkāl kuuthu in the mandram as the drums beat <br/>
and his devotees saw his enthusiastic dance. <br/>
Yet though he danced the marakkāl kuuthu in the mandram,<br/>
he is hard for the gods to know. Sāzhale.<br/>
<br/>
1998. O friend, see!<br/>
When the Kauravas disgraced Draupadi, the Pandavas’ wife, <br/>
he went as a messenger to the Kauravas<br/>
and asked them to give land to the Pandavas,<br/>
but Duriyodhana disgraced him in the assembly. <br/>
Yet even though he was disgraced in that way,<br/>
he swallowed all the worlds surrounded by the sounding ocean<br/>
and spat them out. Sāzhale.<br/>
<br/>
1999. O friends, see.<br/>
He drove the chariot of the Pandavas in the terrible Bharatha war<br/>
and destroyed their enemies, the Kauravas.<br/>
Yet even though he drove the chariot for the Pandavas <br/>
all kings, adorned with garlands, worship him bowing their heads. Sāzhale.<br/>
<br/>
2000. O friend, see!<br/>
He went to the sacrifice of Mahābali,<br/>
the king adorned with cool garlands,<br/>
and begged for three feet of land, <br/>
making those who saw him feel pity. <br/>
Yet even though he begged for those three feet of land,<br/>
he is the highest lord of the seven worlds. Sāzhale!<br/>
<br/>
2001. O friend, see!<br/>
He went as a dwarf to king Mahabali’s sacrifice,<br/>
asked for three feet of land, tricked the king, grew tall <br/>
and measured the world and the sky with his two feet. <br/>
Even though he is the god of Thiruveḷḷam and Thiruvenkaṭam,<br/>
he is in the heart of the poet Kaliyan. Sāzhale.<br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>  106. The end of the eon <br/>
</strong> <br/>
2002. At the end of the eon,<br/>
he swallowed all the gods’ worlds <br/>
and the people of the seven worlds <br/>
surrounded with dark oceans<br/>
and he kept them in his divine stomach for a long time. <br/>
Think about it, O devotees.<br/>
You worship the gods of other religions who are our enemies. <br/>
What good did they do for us? Don’t be ungrateful. <br/>
Worship only our lord in the sky<br/>
who carries a discus smeared with oil.<br/>
<br/>
2003. When the abundant flood came at the end of the eon<br/>
and rose to the sky, the lord with his strong hands<br/>
took all oceans with their water and swallowed them all. <br/>
Everyone knows this. <br/>
Is there anyone in the world or among the gods <br/>
who was not swallowed and spit out by our god? <br/>
O devotees, don’t you know that the world <br/>
is here through his grace?<br/>
<br/>
2004. He swallowed and kept in his stomach<br/>
Shiva with an eye in his forehead, Nānmuhan, the god of the Vedas, <br/>
Indra who rides the white elephant Airāvadam<br/>
and all the other gods and he protected them there<br/>
so that the victorious king of the ocean would not swallow them all.<br/>
It is terrible that mean devotees <br/>
do not praise the good nature of the lord with a victorious discus.<br/>
<br/>
2005. At the end of the eon, the waves of the ocean <br/>
spread everywhere in the world <br/>
and the whole earth became a large ocean. <br/>
He thought that all the seven worlds <br/>
would be destroyed and he swallowed them all<br/>
and kept them in his divine stomach, making it very large. <br/>
He protected you all. <br/>
He has a dark form like a ripe kaḷavam fruit. <br/>
O devotees, why don’t you learn to worship only our unique god’s feet?<br/>
<br/>
2006. At the end of the eon, the whole world was filled with water<br/>
and no one was going to survive.<br/>
He swallowed everyone and kept them in his divine stomach for a long time.<br/>
O devotees, you do not understand that.<br/>
If you understood his power, <br/>
you would praise the thousand names of the generous king of the gods.<br/>
<br/>
2007. At the end of the eon when the large flood<br/>
rose to the sky, he swallowed all the worlds <br/>
and the oceans and protected all. <br/>
O devotees, you praise other new gods.<br/>
Is there anyone who would bathe a wooden board in hot water<br/>
and not bathe their mother who gave birth to them?<br/>
You have no goodness in you.<br/>
If you knew him, you would praise the thousand names<br/>
of our generous lord.<br/>
<br/>
2008. He is our dear lord of Thirukaṇṇamangai<br/>
who protected all, swallowing all the people of the worlds,<br/>
the gods in the sky, the Danavas and all others <br/>
so that the huge flood that came at the end of the eon did not swallow them. <br/>
Any time his devotees do not think of those <br/>
who fail to worship his ankleted feet is sweet for them. <br/>
<br/>
2009. At the end of the eon, the worlds were covered<br/>
with thick darkness and the oceans rose<br/>
in a flood that spread over all the worlds.<br/>
Our god swallowed all the seven golden worlds,<br/>
kept them in his stomach and protected all. <br/>
Any devotees who do not think of the dark shining lord<br/>
are contemptible.<br/>
<br/>
2010. At the end of the eon<br/>
when the waves of the ocean rose and touched the sky, <br/>
he felt pity for his devotees, the gods and the sages,<br/>
gave them his grace and swallowed all the seven worlds<br/>
and kept them in his divine stomach. <br/>
O devotees, sing, dance and praise <br/>
the dark jewel-colored god of cool Kuḍandai who protected you in his stomach.<br/>
<br/>
2011. Kaliyan of Thirumangai surrounded by flourishing groves<br/>
composed a garland of musical pāsurams<br/>
describing how the lord swallowed all the oceans,<br/>
the directions, the Asuras, the gods in the sky and all the worlds <br/>
and how he left no one and nothing without his protection.<br/>
If devotees learn these pāsurams well and recite them,<br/>
they will go to the golden world of the gods,<br/>
receive the grace of Lakshmi on the lotus, and shine. <br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>  107. Thenāli <br/>
</strong> <br/>
2012. The dear lord whose chest is adorned with jewels<br/>
shines like a golden hill and rides on the bird Garuḍa.<br/>
He used Mandara mountain as a churning stick and the snake Vasuki as a rope,<br/>
churned the milky ocean, took the nectar from it and gave it to the gods. <br/>
If devotees have not seen him, their eyes are not truly eyes. <br/>
<br/>
2013. The highest lord who is sweet to his devotees<br/>
shines as a precious jewel that never loses its luster.<br/>
He, the highest and incomparable one,<br/>
went as a dwarf to Mahābali, begged for three feet of land<br/>
and measured the world and the sky with his feet.<br/>
If the ears of devotees have not heard of him they are not truly ears.<br/>
<br/>
2014. The faultless god of Thennāli who is the divine Vedas<br/>
drank the milk of Putana and killed her.<br/>
If devotees have not worshiped and praised Māl’s greatness,<br/>
whatever they say is not truly speech. <br/>
<br/>
2015. The god of the gods with a chest adorned <br/>
with a fragrant fresh thulasi garland<br/>
took the form of a man-lion<br/>
and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws.<br/>
If devotees do not sing his praise, <br/>
the songs that they sing are not real songs.<br/>
<br/>
2016. The lord who stays in the Thirumeyyam hills.<br/>
and carries a conch in his hand<br/>
has the color of the dark ocean, <br/>
of a shining sapphire-like hill, of a dark cloud,<br/>
of a kuvalai flower blooming on a branch and of a kāyām flower.<br/>
If the hands of devotees have not worshiped him,<br/>
they are not truly hands. <br/>
<br/>
2017. When devotees see thulasi dripping with honey,<br/>
fresh alari flowers, kuvilai flowers,<br/>
thorny muḷari blossoms and ambal flowers,<br/>
if they do not think in their hearts of the golden feet of him <br/>
who took the forms of a swan to bring the Vedas to the earth<br/>
and who became a boar that split open the earth <br/>
to bring the earth goddess from the underworld,<br/>
then their hearts are not truly hearts. <br/>
<br/>
2018. If devotees do not bring flowers<br/>
and worship with love and devotion<br/>
the lord who has the color of the sounding ocean, <br/>
of karuvilai flowers and of kāyām flowers<br/>
and if they do not think of him,<br/>
their hearts are not truly hearts.<br/>
<br/>
2019. When he was a little child <br/>
he stole and happily ate the fragrant butter <br/>
that was kept in the uri by the cowherdesses with dark fragrant hair. <br/>
If devotees do not think of the tall god <br/>
whose eyes are beautiful and know him, they will never know him. <br/>
<br/>
2020. The god of Thirumalirunjolai<br/>
where bees drink honey and sing<br/>
fought with seven bulls to marry Nappinnai<br/>
whose eyes are as large and beautiful as flowers. <br/>
If devotees do not become his slaves<br/>
they are not real people. I am sure of that in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
2021. Kaliyan who carries a spear in his hands<br/>
composed ten musical pāsurams<br/>
worshiping the feet of the lord who carries a discus.<br/>
If devotees sing these pāsurams and dance <br/>
all the results of their bad karma will go away. <br/>
----------<br/><br/>
<strong>  108. Bhakthi. Born again <br/>
</strong> <br/>
2022. O Nambi, you are smell, taste, touch and sound.<br/>
When I complain that you have not given me your grace, <br/>
you may say that I did not do the right things. <br/>
I will say one thing to you. <br/>
Do not make me to go into a womb and be born again.<br/>
I am afraid that I will be like a tree<br/>
on the bank of a river that may fall at any time. <br/>
<br/>
 2023. Even though I am angry at you<br/>
who carry a victorious discus, I would tell you this.<br/>
I do not want you to put me in a womb and make me be born again.<br/>
I tremble like the minds of people on a boat caught in a terrible storm. <br/>
<br/>
2024. O my lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,<br/>
I have suffered, born in many births<br/>
and I am worried and afraid <br/>
that you will make me be born again.<br/>
My mind struggles as if I were staying<br/>
under the same roof as a snake. <br/>
<br/>
2025. I am afraid that you, the lord of the eon,<br/>
will make me be born in many more births and suffer.<br/>
My mind is in pain like an ant<br/>
caught on a torch burning at both ends.<br/>
<br/>
2026. I have suffered, born in many births<br/>
and I am afraid you, the ancient god of the eon,<br/>
will make me fall into the hole of birth again.<br/>
My mind shivers like a crowd of foxes caught in a flood. <br/>
<br/>
2027. You are the Maṇāḷan of Vayalāli<br/>
where beautiful neelam flowers bloom<br/>
near the water filled with lovely blossoming lotuses.<br/>
I should not suffer like a tree<br/>
cut down by a shepherd and thrown away. <br/>
Give me your grace so I may reach you.<br/>
<br/>
2028. Like the worm that lives in a margosa tree<br/>
and will not eat anything except its leaves,<br/>
I do not want to be anywhere except beneath your beautiful feet.<br/>
You, a shining light,<br/>
removed the curse of the waning crescent moon<br/>
and you rest on the five-headed Adeshesa.<br/>
<br/>
2029. I want nothing but your grace.<br/>
You are the god of Srirangam <br/>
surrounded with beautiful groves,<br/>
a jewel and a shining diamond.<br/>
O Madhusudhana, you who are the highest light,<br/>
show me the path that leads to moksha.<br/>
<br/>
2030. O my father, show me a path<br/>
so I will not be plunged into indestructible hell. <br/>
Give us, your devotees, your sweet grace always.<br/>
You are the Chandogya Upanishad, our chief with lotus eyes.<br/>
O dear one, give your grace to me, your slave.<br/>
<br/>
2031. Kaliyan, king of famous Thirumangai,<br/>
composed ten pāsurams praising the cowherd,<br/>
the god who protected the cows from the storm<br/>
by carrying Govardhana mountain as an umbrella. <br/>
If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams <br/>
they will never experience the results of their karma. (1083) <br/>

<center><h3>
11. Thirukkurundānḍagam  --  Thirumangaiyāzhvār   (2032 -2051)</h3></center>

2032. I bow and praise him, the wise Thirumāl,<br/>
a  treasure, a coral pillar, my fate. <br/>
He killed Kamsan to protect the world. <br/>
If the devotees think of him as a true path,<br/>
he will give them moksha,<br/>
and I am his devotee and he has entered my heart.<br/>
I will not leave him. <br/>
<br/>
2033. The lord is the earth, wind, water, fire, the sky,<br/>
a beautiful shining jewel, <br/>
nectar, a river of joy for his devotees, <br/>
Yama for the Asuras and he stays in the Himalayas. <br/>
He is as strong as a bull<br/>
and he destroyed Lanka surrounded with protected walls. <br/>
O heart, think of the divine nature of the lord<br/>
and praise him, praise him. <br/>
<br/>
2034. Our father, the highest, churned the wide milky ocean<br/>
using large Mandara mountain as a churning stick<br/>
and the snake Vasuki as a rope,<br/>
took nectar from it and gave it to the gods. <br/>
I worship the young god of Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
filled with thick bamboo groves <br/>
where the rays of the sun cannot go.<br/>
<br/>
2035. I long to see in my dreams <br/>
the sweet lord with the color of a dark Kāyām flower.<br/>
He took the form of a boar<br/>
and brought the earth goddess from beneath the earth.<br/>
I worship him with words and praise him with devotion,<br/>
thinking of him with love in my mind and caring. <br/>
<br/>
2036. He is like hot iron <br/>
and my love for him is like water poured on it<br/>
as he takes my love inside him.<br/>
His love is like sugarcane juice for me . <br/>
I have become a slave for the sweet one and I am saved.<br/>
<br/>
2037. He, the god of Kuḍandai shining like a pile of diamonds, <br/>
is the first one among all the three gods, <br/>
the king of the whole world, <br/>
sweet poetry, fresh honey and pure gold<br/>
and the flowers that adorn the hair of the gods in the sky. <br/>
What can his devotees say to praise him?<br/>
<br/>
2038. The lord of Srirangam, <br/>
surrounded by flourishing water<br/>
is this birth, future births, moksha and truth for his devotees.<br/>
Bowing my head, I worship the devotees <br/>
of the dark faultless lord who think of the wonderful nature <br/>
of the unique god of Thiruvenkaṭam. <br/>
<br/>
2039. Thirumal, colored like a cloud in the sky,<br/>
is the honey that bees make in the hills,<br/>
sugarcane juice and a treasure.<br/>
If devotees do not embrace him and live <br/>
they do not realize that their human birth is a waste.<br/>
If the devotees think of him always <br/>
they will find happiness in their lives. <br/>
<br/>
2040. My heart, confused and unable to stay on one thought,<br/>
suffers like an ant on a torch burning at both end.<br/>
You are wise, the god of the gods in the sky,<br/>
the light that swallowed the whole world. <br/>
I have no help but you for all my seven births. <br/>
<br/>
2041. You are my father, a pearl, a shining emerald, <br/>
with the color of a cloud <br/>
shining with lightning and roaring with thunder. <br/>
My mind is not steady—what can I do? <br/>
I have done bad karma.<br/>
Give me your grace and tell me what should I do<br/>
to love you with devotion.<br/>
You are my lord and I know nothing except being a slave for you<br/>
and loving you with devotion.<br/>
<br/>
2042. O father, give me your grace so that I may serve you, <br/>
praise you and worship your feet. <br/>
You are the world, the ancient god of all eight directions,<br/>
justice and the highest light. Take away all my worries. <br/>
I will praise only you.<br/>
<br/>
2043. You, the life of all, stay in Srirangam.<br/>
When I, your impure devotee, was afraid <br/>
because I have done bad karma<br/>
and I worried how I am going to escape its results, <br/>
you, the kāvi-flower-colored lord came, <br/>
entered my heart and said, “Do not be afraid.”<br/>
<br/>
2044. My eyes rejoiced seeing the god,<br/>
sweet as sugarcane, of Srirangam <br/>
surrounded with groves where bees swarm. <br/>
Just as water sprinkled on iron dries up,<br/>
my sorrows and karma have gone away. <br/>
<br/>
2045. I, a sinner, always thought of embracing women<br/>
whose beautiful eyes vanquish Kāvi flowers,<br/>
plunged into my desires and was destroyed<br/>
without thinking of you,<br/>
god of Kuḍanthai surrounded with water <br/>
where swans that have beautiful feathers live. <br/>
<br/>
2046. Hanuman, your messenger, went to Lanka, <br/>
burned Rāvaṇa’s Lanka surrounded with strong walls,<br/>
came back and bowed devotedly to Rama's feet. <br/>
Even though I cannot do what he did, I am your devotee.<br/>
With my bones melting, I take the water of knowledge <br/>
with the love that is my heart and bathe you in it.<br/>
<br/>
2047. Our lord killed the Rakshasa Mārisan <br/>
when he came as a magical deer,<br/>
walked between the marudam trees <br/>
and destroyed the two Asurans,<br/>
measured the world and the sky with his feet at Mahābali's sacrifice, <br/>
and churned the milky ocean, took the nectar from it<br/>
and gave it to the gods in the sky.<br/>
I, his devotee, adorn my dear lord<br/>
with a pure beautiful garland made of my praise.<br/>
<br/>
2048. If devotees praise the compassion of the generous lord <br/>
they will not be born again.<br/>
The world says that even those devotees<br/>
who, like Sisupālan, scolded him were saved by him<br/>
and reached moksha. <br/>
Though I am ignorant and have many desires, <br/>
I praise him and do not scold him<br/>
because I do not want to be born again. <br/>
I have abundant love for him and wish to join the lord<br/>
whose color is like the wave-filled ocean.<br/>
.<br/>
2049. If someone removes the weakness <br/>
that comes from ignorance and egoism<br/>
and closes his eyes and controls the desires of the five senses, <br/>
loving only him and not letting his thoughts wander, <br/>
he will see the shining light that is truly the lord.<br/>
<br/>
2050. When the skull of the Nānmuhan on the lotus <br/>
was stuck to Shiva's hand<br/>
and he wandered among houses begging for food, <br/>
our lord removed the curse of Shiva and made it fall off.<br/>
If devotees go to Thirukkaṇḍiyur, Srirangam, <br/>
Thirumeyyam, Thirukkachi, Thirupperur <br/>
and Thirukkaḍalmallai,<br/>
and worship him, they will be saved.<br/>
How can others be saved if they do not worship him?<br/>
<br/>
2051. Kaliyan with a strong spear<br/>
composed a beautiful garland of twenty Tamil pasurams <br/>
on our lovely-eyed lord.<br/>
Indra, the king of gods and Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus<br/>
worship his feet every day,<br/>
sprinkling flowers that drip with honey. <br/>
If devotees learn and recite these twenty pasurams faultlessly <br/>
they will go to the bright sky and rule there.<br/>

12.  Thiruneḍunthāṇḍagam   -  Thirumangaiyāzhvār  (2052 – 2081)</h3></center>
<br/>
This book is divided into three parts. <br/>
1. Praise of the god .<br/>
2. A mother speak about her daughter who loves Kaṇṇan.<br/>
3. The daughter who loves Kaṇṇan talks about her love with her friend. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>  Praising god<br/>
</strong> <br/>
2052. Shining like lightning, he is the four Vedas,<br/>
the light of a lamp, the rising crescent moon,<br/>
the past and the future.<br/>
Without sickness, old age, birth or death,<br/>
he is gold and diamond<br/>
and shines as the five elements–earth, water, fire, wind and sky.<br/>
He, my father, enters me with his true form<br/>
and I keep his divine shoot-like feet on my head.<br/>
<br/>
2053. He is fire, water, wind, sky and earth,<br/>
all religions and all the three gods,. <br/>
Shiva is colored red like fire, Nānmuhan is colored like gold<br/>
and Thirumāl is colored like the ocean—<br/>
our lord shines with all their three forms together.<br/>
<br/>
2054. Neḍumal with his divine body who is far away<br/>
shone with the white color of a conch in the Treta yuga. <br/>
When he took the nectar from the milky ocean,<br/>
our divine Thirumāl had a dark blue color.<br/>
We cannot say that he has only one form,<br/>
we can only praise him saying <br/>
that he has different forms in each eon.<br/>
Who has seen the dark beautiful-eyed god?<br/>
Who can describe him?<br/>
<br/>
2055. Our lord who is more ancient than Indra and Nānmuhan. <br/>
is the five elements–the large earth, wind, fire water and sky,<br/>
the beautiful sound of Tamil,<br/>
the words of the northern language,<br/>
the four directions, the sun and moon.<br/>
Even the gods in the sky do not know him and his divine nature.<br/>
He is the secret of the mantras of the Vedas <br/>
that the Vediyars recite in the evening. <br/>
O ignorant heart, do not forget those mantras.<br/>
If you recite them always and live, you will be saved.<br/>
<br/>
2056. When he came as a dwarf to king Mahābali’s sacrifice, <br/>
he measured the earth and the ocean with one foot<br/>
and he raised his other foot to the wide sky <br/>
spreading over all the eight directions <br/>
and crossed the cool moon, the sun and the stars<br/>
and went still above, <br/>
going beyond all the thoughts in the Asuran Mahābali’s mind.<br/>
I worship the flower-like divine feet of my father<br/>
that measured the whole earth and the sky. <br/>
<br/>
2057. He, the god of the gods, is generous <br/>
and he gives to his devotees <br/>
as much as they want with his ample hands.<br/>
He rides on the beautiful-winged Garuḍa, <br/>
conquers the Asuras, not giving them his grace.<br/>
O heart, let us go and praise his feet in beautiful Thirukkovalur<br/>
where the Peṇṇai river flows flourishing <br/>
through many lands filling ponds with its water<br/>
and bringing with its waves<br/>
tall bamboo plants that throw out pearls<br/>
and leaving gold on its banks. <br/>
<br/>
2058. He came as Parasurāman, fought with kings<br/>
whose arms are wide and strong as mountains,<br/>
conquered them and ruled the world, 			<br/>
and he conquered Murugan <br/>
who threw his spear at the ocean to fight with Asurans.<br/>
He stays in Thirukkovalur<br/>
where famous king Malaiyarasan worshiped him,<br/>
surrounded by fragrant groves <br/>
and filled with long streets and lotus ponds,<br/>
guarded by the lovely chaste goddess of the Vindya mountains.<br/>
O heart, come, let us go and worship him there.<br/>
<br/>
2059. You are in the hearts of your devotees<br/>
and in Thiruneeragam, on the top of Thiruneermalai, <br/>
Nilāthingalthuṇḍam in Thiruppadi, <br/>
Thiruvuragam in flourishing Kachi, <br/>
and Thiruvekka surrounded with flourishing water.<br/>
The whole world worships you, the god of Thirukkāragam.<br/>
O thief, you stay in the sky and in Thirupperur <br/>
where on the southern bank of the Kāviri <br/>
beautiful flowers bloom in the groves. <br/>
You, the highest one, stay in my heart and you will not leave me.<br/>
I worship only your divine feet. <br/>
<br/>
2060. You stay in Thirumallai on the ocean<br/>
where ships bring precious diamonds<br/>
and in Kachi surrounded with forts and in Thirupperur.<br/>
As part of your body, you have Shiva,<br/>
adorned with a beautiful kondrai garland dripping with honey<br/>
who shares his body with Shakthi, the daughter of the king of the Himalayas. <br/>
You, the highest in the world, beautiful as coral,<br/>
rest on Adisesha on the milky ocean<br/>
and stay on the peak of the Himalayas, the snow mountains.<br/>
I, a poor man, wander everywhere looking for you.<br/>
<br/>
2061. You, the famous one, guarded the seven worlds <br/>
and I am your poor devotee.<br/>
What can I do except prattle on, saying,<br/>
“What are you? Who are you?” <br/>
You are the god of the southern, northern, eastern and western lands<br/>
praised by the whole world,<br/>
the first among the gods, a bright light worshiped by all.<br/>
You are the past and the future. <br/>
You, the origin of all, stay in Thirumuzhikkaḍalmallai.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>  A worrying mother! <br/>
</strong> <br/>
2062. Her mother says, <br/>
“My daughter wears silk garments. <br/>
She feels tired and sad<br/>
and doesn’t want to play with her doll. <br/>
Her eyes are filled with tears and she can’t sleep.<br/>
She doesn’t want to sit on my lap at all.<br/>
She asks, ‘Where is my lord’s Srirangam?’<br/>
I asked the fortune teller about her<br/>
‘O fortune teller, <br/>
my daughter whose fragrant hair swarms with bees <br/>
that have drunk honey from flowers is as soft as a doe.<br/>
Who makes her worry like this? Tell me the truth.’<br/>
She said, ‘It is the ocean-colored god.’<br/>
He is our protector<br/>
and if he has done this who can save us?”<br/>
<br/>
2063. “My daughter’s heart melts with love for him <br/>
and her eyes are filled with tears.<br/>
She stands searching until she is tired.<br/>
She sighs and doesn’t want to eat or sleep. <br/>
She says, ‘O Nambi, who rest on the snake bed,<br/>
you are lord of Thiruvayalāli<br/>
surrounded with beautiful creepers blooming with flowers.<br/>
O friend! Shall we go there dance and sing <br/>
where the Garuḍa flag flies?<br/>
Can we go and play in the water in beautiful Srirangam?’<br/>
I gave birth to this girl but she doesn’t listen to me.<br/>
A pity! The world is blaming me for what she does.”<br/>
<br/>
2064. “My daughter says,<br/>
‘You carried Govardhana mountain <br/>
and protected the cows and the cowherds from the storm<br/>
and you stay in Thiruvarangam in beautiful Kachi.<br/>
You, the king resting on Adisesha in Thiruvekka<br/>
broke the bow and married Sita and embraced her soft arms,<br/>
and you fought with the wrestlers and killed them.<br/>
You are young and strong and you killed the Asuran Kesi<br/>
when he came as a horse.’<br/>
She teaches her parrot to say his names,<br/>
shedding tears and they drip on her breasts <br/>
and she is tired.”<br/>
<br/>
2065. “My daughter says, <br/>
‘He is a sprouting shoot with the dark color of a cloud<br/>
and he stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi.<br/>
He is the first one, without any end, <br/>
who came as a dwarf, grew tall <br/>
and crossed over all the three worlds at Mahābali’s sacrifice.<br/>
Faultless, limitless nectar, he stays in Srirangam.<br/>
and in the minds of the Vediyars.<br/>
Like the brightness of a lamp and precious like an emerald,<br/>
he stays in Thiruthangā and Thiruvekkaa.’<br/>
When my daughter sings the praise of Thirumāl  <br/>
her parrot listens and sings with her. <br/>
She is happy that she taught her beautiful parrot the praise of the lord <br/>
and she says ‘I taught you the praise of the lord and I am happy to hear that from you. ’ ------------<br/><br/>
<strong>  She folds  her hands and worships him.”<br/>
</strong> <br/>
2066. “My daughter says, <br/>
‘He, mighty as an elephant, <br/>
stays in Kachi surrounded by strong stone walls. <br/>
He is a sweet fruit and he rests on Adisesha on the ocean.<br/>
Our father happily stays in beautiful Thiruvazhundur<br/>
surrounded with fields, ponds and blooming alli flowers.’<br/>
My innocent daughter carries a veena <br/>
that touches her breasts, smiles beautifully <br/>
and plucks it with her fingers, making them red<br/>
as she sings like a prattling parrot.”<br/>
<br/>
2067. “My daughter says, <br/>
‘You, mighty as a bull, happily grazed the cows.<br/>
You are my sweet fruit and you stay in Thirukkaṇṇapuram<br/>
surrounded with fragrant groves. <br/>
You are the god of Thiruvenkaṭam in the north<br/>
and you danced happily in the mandram.<br/>
You stay in Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with abundant groves.<br/>
O king, you conquered the Asurans and destroyed their tribes,<br/>
and you, with a dark color and thick curly hair, are my help.’<br/>
The tears she sheds fall on her breasts and she is tired.”<br/>
<br/>
2068. “My daughter’s round soft breasts <br/>
have changed their color to gold and are pale. <br/>
Her fish eyes are filled with tears. <br/>
She melts when she hears the voice of the lovely red-legged dove<br/>
calling softly for its mate.<br/>
Praising Thiruthangaa, flourishing Thirukkuḍanthai<br/>
and Thirukkovalur where he stays, she sings and dances. <br/>
When I asked my daughter,<br/>
‘Dear girl, do you think what you’re doing is good for our family?’<br/>
she only praises Thirunaraiyur and sings.”<br/>
<br/>
2069. “My daughter says, <br/>
‘Colored like a dark cloud,<br/>
he has hands and feet that are like beautiful lotuses.<br/>
He loves the beautiful earth goddess<br/>
and he is crazy about doll-like Lakshmi.’ <br/>
What have I done?<br/>
My lovely innocent daughter doesn’t listen to me,<br/>
but asks me, ‘Where is Srirangam of my divine lord?<br/>
I will go to Thiruneermalai where the ocean-colored lord stays.’<br/>
Is this the way women talk who have lost their chastity?”<br/>
<br/>
2070. “My daughter’s breasts have not grown out yet.<br/>
Even though she knows that beautiful Lakshmi stays on his chest <br/>
she lost her chastity for him. <br/>
She sighs and says to her friend,<br/>
‘O friend, shall we go to Srirangam and play in the water?’<br/>
I gave birth to her but she doesn’t listen to me. <br/>
She just sings and praises the names <br/>
of the god of Thirupperur and Thirukkuḍandai<br/>
and goes to bathe in the ponds <br/>
where golden lotuses bloom. <br/>
There is no one precious like her for me.<br/>
Does your daughter, precious as gold,<br/>
do the same things as mine?”<br/>
<br/>
2071. Her mother says, <br/>
“He, the generous lord, burned the southern Lanka <br/>
and destroyed the wealth of the Rakshasa Rāvaṇa<br/>
who carried a shining sword and drove his chariot heroically. <br/>
He cut off the thousand arms of Vāṇāsuran,<br/>
and as a dwarf, he measured the world with one foot <br/>
and crossed the earth with the other.<br/>
He, ruler of the world, swallowed the earth, spat it out <br/>
and kept it again in his stomach and protects it.<br/>
My daughter praises his divine names always <br/>
and we can only say that she must have done marvellous tapas<br/>
to praise his names always on this earth.<br/>
-------------<br/><br/>
<strong>  The daughter’s worry <br/>
</strong> <br/>
2072. The daughter says to her friend , <br/>
“O friend, the dark-colored lord with fragrant hair <br/>
hunts with a strong bow. <br/>
He wore shining emerald earrings swinging from both his ears.<br/>
He came together with Lakshmi and stood in front of me<br/>
and I was fascinated with his beautiful lotus hands, <br/>
mouth, eyes and feet.<br/>
O friend, I was afraid he might be divine.” <br/>
<br/>
2073. The daughter says,<br/>
“He came, sang the raga naivaḷam,<br/>
and looked at me, standing there as if he was shy.<br/>
As soon as I heard his song, <br/>
my mind and eyes went to the dear lord<br/>
and I bowed to his divine feet. <br/>
The bracelets on my hands and the mekalai on my waist<br/>
became loose and fell and I couldn’t see them. <br/>
I saw only his golden emerald earrings and his four arms.<br/>
I asked him, ‘How far is the temple of our dear lord?’<br/>
and he answered, ‘This indeed is the beautiful Thiruvāli, his temple.’”<br/>
<br/>
2074. The daughter says,<br/>
“He gave me his love and made my heart suffer.<br/>
He made my golden color turn pale <br/>
and my shining bangles become loose. <br/>
He told me, ‘My place is Srirangam <br/>
where fish drink the sweet water <br/>
dripping from the young coconut trees’ and left. <br/>
I saw him adorned with fresh thulasi garland <br/>
that drips honey in my dream<br/>
and told him, ‘O lord, you ride on Garuḍa, don’t go away.<br/>
Whatever is happening, it seems that are quarreling.” X<br/>
<br/>
2075. Her daughter says, <br/>
“What a pity!<br/>
The conch bangles on my hands have grown loose.<br/>
The ocean-colored lord<br/>
with a conch in one hand and in the other a discus<br/>
and who swallowed the whole world<br/>
came here, loved me, told me that he stays in Srirangam<br/>
and went, leaving me with the sorrow of love <br/>
and filling my eyes that are like fighting fish with tears.”<br/>
<br/>
2076. Her daughter says, <br/>
“The heroic lord who killed the elephant Kuvalayābeedam <br/>
with his mighty arms and shines like lightning <br/>
has a beautiful mouth and eyes<br/>
and wears a fresh fragrant thulasi garland and emerald earrings. <br/>
He took away my health, chastity, and thoughts,<br/>
making my bangles loose and I became his slave.<br/>
As he went through the fragrant cherundi grove <br/>
blooming with golden flowers,<br/>
he said his place is Srirangam surrounded with water and left.”<br/>
<br/>
2077. Her daughter says, <br/>
“O small bee with six legs and dots on your wings,<br/>
you and your mate stay happily on flowers and drink honey. <br/>
I bow to you. Go to the god of the gods<br/>
who loves the cows and grazes them<br/>
and stays in beautiful Thiruvazhundur.<br/>
Stay there and see him. Don’t be afraid. <br/>
Tell him , ‘I am a girl and love him.’<br/>
and see what he says.”<br/>
<br/>
2078. The daughter says,<br/>
“O beautiful red-legged crane,<br/>
if you go today to Thirukkaṇṇapuram <br/>
and tell my beloved lovely-eyed Thirumāl of my love, <br/>
nothing could make me more happy.<br/>
I will give you all this flourishing land<br/>
and fish from the ponds to eat.<br/>
You and your beloved mate can come here, <br/>
stay happily and enjoy your life.”<br/>
<br/>
2079. The daughter says, <br/>
“O friend, he who destroyed the forts of southern Lanka <br/>
and killed the Rakshasas,<br/>
measured the earth and the sky<br/>
and drove the chariot for Arjuna in the Bharatha war<br/>
is large as a mountain and strong as an elephant.<br/>
I will embrace him with my gold-ornamented breasts.<br/>
I won’t let him go. I will plunge into the love for him<br/>
thinking always of him, <br/>
melting with joy that fills my body.”<br/>
<br/>
2080. The daughter says,<br/>
“My lord, the beloved of Nappinnai the cowherd girl,<br/>
churned the milky ocean with waves, <br/>
shot his arrows and killed the king of the Rakshasas<br/>
whose strength never failed, conquering and destroying the Raksasas, <br/>
and carried Govardhana mountain in his arms, protecting the cows. <br/>
I am his slave and I worship Neḍumāl,<br/>
the tall god of cool Thirukuḍanthai and Thiruvinnagaram<br/>
surrounded by the ocean rolling with waves.<br/>
<br/>
2081. When the gods and the sages praised <br/>
and worshiped you saying,<br/>
“You are the god of the gods in the sky. Give us your grace,”<br/>
you, our father with the color of a dark cloud shining with lightning,<br/>
took the form of a swan, brought up the divine Vedas<br/>
from the bottom of the ocean and taught them to the sages. <br/>
Kaliyan, with a sharp spear, Yama for his enemies<br/>
and the chief of Thirumangai filled with palaces<br/>
studded with precious shining jewels,<br/>
