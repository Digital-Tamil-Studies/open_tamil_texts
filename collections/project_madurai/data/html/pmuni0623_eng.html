<br/>
2082. The world is a lamp for me,<br/>
wide ocean is its ghee,<br/>
and the warm sun is its light. <br/>
I place this garland of words on the feet <br/>
of the lord with a shining discus<br/>
and ask him to take me from the ocean of sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
2083. I do not know when you churned the milky ocean<br/>
or when the whole earth was surrounded with the seas,<br/>
all I know is that the world is created by you <br/>
and you swallowed and spat it out at the end of the eon.<br/>
<br/>
2084. With one foot you measured the whole world<br/>
and with the other rose to the sky and measured it. <br/>
O wonderful lord!<br/>
I cannot understand how you are able to measure the world <br/>
and sky like that.<br/>
<br/>
2085. Our god opens the door of moksha for those<br/>
who control their five senses<br/>
and he himself is the path of moksha. <br/>
Shiva who taught dharma to the four sages<br/>
staying under the shadow of a banyan tree<br/>
and drank poison when the milky ocean was churned<br/>
understands the power of Thirumāl<br/>
and is a part of our lord’s body, <br/>
<br/>
2086. The names of Thirumāl and Shiva are Nāraṇan and Haran<br/>
and Garuḍa and a bull are their vehicles.<br/>
They taught the Vedas and the Agamas to the sages,<br/>
Kailasa and the milky ocean are their temples<br/>
and their actions are protecting and destroying the world.<br/>
One carries a discus and the other spear in his hand,<br/>
and one has a dark shining body like a cloud <br/>
and the other a body like fire. <br/>
<br/>
2087. He has the color of the ocean rolling with waves<br/>
and I have never forgotten him. <br/>
O, innocent ones, how could I forget him today.<br/>
Even when I was in the womb, <br/>
I worshiped the lord folding my hands, and I saw the god <br/>
as I gazed in the direction of Srirangam where he stays. <br/>
<br/>
2088. Our lord is in all the directions with all the gods<br/>
and is in all the actions that they do and in their results.<br/>
All these things are the illusions of Neḍumāl<br/>
who is the everlasting cloud-colored Kaṇṇan,<br/>
<br/>
2089. O Thirumāl, why did you put the conch in your mouth<br/>
and blow it and mesmerize all when you fought in the <br/>
Bharatha battle holding your heroic weapon, the discus in your hand?<br/>
Why did you hide the sun with the wheel of a chariot?<br/>
<br/>
2090. You took the form boar and on your single tusk<br/>
you brought up the earth goddess from the underworld.<br/>
Was that not the same earth that you measured <br/>
with your divine feet <br/>
as the sky and all the directions trembled? <br/>
<br/>
2091. O lord with a heroic discus!<br/>
People say that you really swallowed the earth, hills,<br/>
the oceans rolling with waves, the wind and the sky.<br/>
If one tries to understand how you did that,<br/>
was your mouth as big as the whole earth at that time? <br/>
<br/>
2092. He measured the world with his feet <br/>
and my mouth will not praise any other but him. <br/>
My hands will not worship anyone but him <br/>
who drank the poisonous milk <br/>
from the breasts of the devil Putanā.<br/>
My eyes will not see anyone except him<br/>
and my ears will not hear any other name except his. <br/>
<br/>
2093. The nature of the lord who took the form of a boar to bring <br/>
the earth goddess from the underworld is<br/>
the feelings of all the five sense organs—<br/>
ears, mouth, eyes, nose and body—<br/>
and hot fire, earth, wind, water and the sky, <br/>
undiminished wisdom, knowledge and good dharma.<br/>
<br/>
2094. They who were born as people in ancient times, <br/>
recited the sastras and the Vedas in the proper way <br/>
and worshiped him with the correct rules<br/>
became the excellent gods and reached<br/>
the feet of the lord adorned with a thulasi garland.<br/>
<br/>
2095. People praise various gods in the ways they know,<br/>
saying, “This or that god is our dear lord,”<br/>
and they put their pictures on the wall and worship them,<br/>
but any god that they pray to is only our lord. <br/>
<br/>
2096. The three gods came first, <br/>
and among them the ocean-colored god was first. <br/>
If we do not have his grace,<br/>
the grace given by any of the others is just a waste. <br/>
<br/>
2097. When I realized that I have spent all my days in vain, <br/>
I was afraid and cried, <br/>
and I worshiped the feet of the ocean colored lord with lovely eyes<br/>
resting on Adisesha, the snake bed<br/>
as the water of the strong waves touches his feet. <br/>
<br/>
2098. People praise his heroism and say, <br/>
“When the lord who split open the chest of the Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws <br/>
measured the world, riding on Garuḍa,<br/>
one foot was on the earth and his head touched the sky<br/>
while his arms were extended in all the directions.”<br/>
<br/>
2099. The lord drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of Putanā, <br/>
fought and conquered the elephant Kuvalayaabeedam, <br/>
split open the mouth of the Asuran that came in the form of a bird, <br/>
entered between the Marudu trees and killed the Raksasas,<br/>
and ate the butter from the uri happily. <br/>
He measured the world and the sky at the sacrifice of Mahābali, <br/>
<br/>
2100. O dark ocean, <br/>
Thirumāl has a dark body and beautiful eyes. <br/>
He swallowed the earth<br/>
and slept on a banyan leaf as a baby at the end of the eon<br/>
rests on you, carrying a discus. <br/>
What penance you have done<br/>
to touch always the divine dark body of the lord? <br/>
<br/>
2101. The gods sprinkle fresh flowers, fold their hands <br/>
and worship the beautiful divine lotus feet of the lord<br/>
who cut the chains on the ankles of his father and released him<br/>
and took the form of a dwarf<br/>
and swallowed the earth and the sky. <br/>
<br/>
2102. Lovely-eyed Thirumāl with a discus<br/>
who rides on the bird Garuda<br/>
rests on the snake Adishesa.<br/>
He took water from Mahābali’s hand, <br/>
asked for three feet of land, <br/>
measured the earth with one foot <br/>
and raised his other foot to measure the sky.<br/>
O heart, you know that we should go to him, our refuge.<br/>
<br/>
2103. O lord, you ride on Garuda with dotted wings! <br/>
Yashoda with arms soft and round like bamboo <br/>
tied you with a rope when you stole butter and ate it. <br/>
It is not only I, but the whole world that knows this— <br/>
I have seen the rope marks on your body.<br/>
<br/>
2104. The lord with the color of the ocean rolling with waves<br/>
has scars on his fingers from using his Sharngam bow, <br/>
a mark on his shoulders where Lakshmi leaned on him<br/>
and a scar on his feet from when he kicked Sakaṭāsuran,<br/>
the Asuran in the form of a cart. <br/>
His fingers are swollen<br/>
because he split open with his claws the chest of Hiraṇyan <br/>
as Lakshmi, her hair adorned with flowers, saw him in fear.<br/>
<br/>
2105. O lord with the color of the ocean rolling with waves,<br/>
when Yasodha the cowherdess saw butter on your mouth and fingers <br/>
and tied you to the mortar, you did not cry loudly<br/>
and the neighbors did not hear you. <br/>
Why you did that? Tell me. <br/>
<br/>
2106. My heart praises without ceasing the emerald-colored lord <br/>
who stays in the hills and rests on the ocean.<br/>
He split open the chest of Hiraṇyan<br/>
and, taking the form of a boar, split open the earth<br/>
and went to the underworld to bring up the earth goddess.<br/>
<br/>
2107. If devotees get up in the morning, <br/>
go to Thiruvenkaṭam hills that brighten the mind<br/>
and if every day they worship the lord who wears a thulasi garland, <br/>
the results of their karma will be removed. <br/>
<br/>
2108. The hands of the lord that carry a strong bow<br/>
carried Govardhana hills to save the cows and the cowherds.<br/>
He split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird, <br/>
broke seven maraa trees with his bow, <br/>
broke the tusks of the heroic elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam,<br/>
and made the blooming kurundam trees fall.<br/>
<br/>
2109. O god with the dark color of a cloud,<br/>
you carry in your hands the valampuri conch and a discus, <br/>
embrace Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth on your chest, <br/>
have Brahma, the creator of the wonderful Vedas on your navel, <br/>
and have Shiva, the destroyer of the three forts in your body.<br/>
<br/>
2110. He is the earth, the wide sky, the wind,<br/>
the roaring ocean and hot fire.<br/>
Know that the lord with lovely eyes <br/>
removed the suffering of Gajendra <br/>
with beautiful eyes and tusks like crescent moon <br/>
when he was caught by a crocodile.<br/>
You know that he will appear when his devotees are in trouble <br/>
and help them. <br/>
<br/>
2111. If devotees keep their hearts pure, <br/>
follow the good path <br/>
and understand clearly what wisdom is,<br/>
their hearts will go to the feet of the lord <br/>
adorned with thulasi garland, <br/>
like a calf that goes to his mother<br/>
understanding that she is his mother. <br/>
<br/>
2112. Even for the time that to blink an eye<br/>
I will not think of anything except the feet of Thirumāl <br/>
who carries a valampuri conch in one hand <br/>
and a golden discus in the other<br/>
and took the form of a man-lion,<br/>
went to Hiraṇyan and split open his chest. <br/>
<br/>
2113. If devotees remove all faults from their minds, <br/>
meditate without blinking their eyes,<br/>
avoid the pleasures of the five senses,<br/>
and embrace only him in their hearts,-<br/>
they will reach the heaven of the lord, <br/>
resting on Adishesa, the thousand-mouthed snake. <br/>
<br/>
2114. The good-natured lord, giving his grace to all, <br/>
taught the Vedas to Brahma so Brahma could give them to the world. <br/>
What is the use if you just recite his names<br/>
and do evening rites without thinking of him in your mind? <br/>
<br/>
2115. O cloud-colored one,<br/>
you swallowed all the seven worlds <br/>
and slept on the banyan leaf.<br/>
The cowherd mother Yashoda whose eyes are large and beautiful, <br/>
fed you milk from her breasts<br/>
without worrying that you had drunk milk from the devil Putanā.<br/>
All people say that your deeds are true.<br/>
<br/>
2116. O tall one, do not think that we are blaming you—<br/>
what we say is because of our love for you. <br/>
Didn’t the ten-headed Rāvaṇa oppose you <br/>
because he wanted to reach your feet?<br/>
<br/>
2117. With a golden discus in your hand<br/>
you fought with Hiraṇyan and split open his chest, <br/>
and you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali at his sacrifice <br/>
and measured the world and the sky. <br/>
Didn’t you do this because you wanted<br/>
to remove the strength of your enemy kings?<br/>
<br/>
2118. In the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,<br/>
the favorite place for Thirumāl who blows a white conch, <br/>
the Vediyars recite the Vedas <br/>
and the learned ones proficient in the good sastras <br/>
carry fragrant lamps, flowers and water, <br/>
come from all directions, go and worship him.<br/>
<br/>
2119. The hill where the Asurans and the gods<br/>
come and worship Thirumāl who, shining like a jewel, <br/>
killed the snake and conquered the heroic elephant of the gypsies<br/>
is Thiruvenkaṭam where the clouds with lightning float. <br/>
<br/>
2120. The lord who rests on the wide ocean<br/>
split open the earth to save the earth goddess, <br/>
carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows and the cowherds, <br/>
frightened the Asuran Kamsan and conquered him<br/>
and abides in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.<br/>
If I want to recite his names, they are so many. <br/>
<br/>
2121. It is the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where gypsies with fine bows and arrows <br/>
carry hot fires in their hands<br/>
and the elephants see them and leave the forest,<br/>
frightened because they think they are stars falling from the sky. <br/>
It is there that the lord stays <br/>
who rejoiced when he conquered the Asuras. <br/>
<br/>
2122. O my heart, even if our mistakes are as large as hills, <br/>
the lord with a golden discus in his hand<br/>
will not be angry with us.<br/>
He will only feel happy for the good qualities that we have. <br/>
From today, even if all the heroic deeds of the lord <br/>
are only untrue gossip, <br/>
you should always think of them as true and believe them.<br/>
<br/>
2123. Even though Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, <br/>
the earth goddess and the daughter of the cowherd family love him, <br/>
the heart of the ocean-colored god resting on the snake bed <br/>
embraces only Lakshmi from the milky ocean.<br/>
<br/>
2124. If devotees carry flowers and water<br/>
and go to him to worship his feet, <br/>
the fault in their minds and the results of their bad karma <br/>
will disappear<br/>
and they will achieve whatever they want. <br/>
<br/>
2125. In whatever form the devotees wish to see him, <br/>
he will appear to them in that form.<br/>
Whatever name the devotees want to call him <br/>
happily he will have that name. <br/>
When they meditate on him quietly without blinking their eyes, <br/>
whatever color they think he has,<br/>
he will appear in that color, carrying his discus. <br/>
<br/>
2126. The gods in the sky may not know him, but let that be.<br/>
O good heart, we know his heroic nature.<br/>
When Ravana disguised himself pretending he had only one head <br/>
and asked for a boon from Brahma, <br/>
Thirumāl came in the form of a baby,<br/>
and, lying on Brahma’s lap, he counted all the heads of Ravana <br/>
so that Brahma would know the Raksasa Ravana<br/>
was the one asking for the boon. <br/>
<br/>
2127. When the skull of Nānmuhan, <br/>
the giver of the Vedas to the world,<br/>
was stuck to the palm of Shiva when he wandered <br/>
as a beggar wearing a white thread, <br/>
Thirumāl cut his own body <br/>
and poured his blood into the skull of Nānmuhan, <br/>
to release Shiva from his curse.<br/>
If devotees worship our lord, they will rule the earth <br/>
and enjoy their lives like gods in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2128. If devotees control their five senses <br/>
that are as mighty as rutting elephants, <br/>
not allowing them to wander <br/>
and keeping them on a good path, <br/>
they will see with true wisdom the lord's ankleted feet <br/>
that once saved the snake when it was in distress.<br/>
<br/>
2129. He carries a conch in one hand and in the other <br/>
a fiery discus that he threw at the Asuras<br/>
as the gods and the Asurans looked on and were terrified.<br/>
O heart, be happy that we could reach the divine feet of the lord. <br/>
<br/>
2130. It is not possible for devotees<br/>
to see the ancient cloud-colored god<br/>
adorned with a shining golden crown, <br/>
unless they are born many times on this earth in various forms<br/>
that change like the colors of a peacock's wings.<br/>
<br/>
2131. The lord received three feet of land from generous Mahābali <br/>
after taking water from his hands and grew tall <br/>
to measure the earth and the sky with his two feet.<br/>
If devotees control their five senses <br/>
and worship him sprinkling fresh flowers,<br/>
it is easy for them to see him <br/>
<br/>
2132. The lord came in the form of a man-lion <br/>
and fought fiercely with the matchless Hiraṇyan and killed him. <br/>
If you wish to see his feet,<br/>
make your thoughts pure,<br/>
think and worship him reciting his divine names, <br/>
and he will present himself to you.<br/>
<br/>
2133. The eight Vasus, eleven Rudras,<br/>
twelve suns and two Asvins<br/>
carry beautiful flowers and go to Thirumāl everyday<br/>
to adorn him with garlands, folding their hands <br/>
and worshiping him always.<br/>
<br/>
2134. When Thirumāl walks the snake Ādisesha is his umbrella, <br/>
when he sits he is a throne for him<br/>
and he is his sandals when he stands.<br/>
He is a floating bed for the god on the ocean always, <br/>
a beautiful lamp, a soft silky dress, <br/>
and the pillow the lord loves to rest on.<br/>
<br/>
2135. He is the lovely-eyed lord<br/>
who conquered the snake Kālingan, <br/>
fought with the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam,<br/>
killed the Asurans when they came as kurundam trees, <br/>
split open the beak of the Asuran that came as a bird, <br/>
killed the wrestlers sent by Kamsan,<br/>
drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,<br/>
danced the Kuravai dance, <br/>
carried Govardhana hill as an umbrella <br/>
to protect the cows that he grazed and the cowherds, <br/>
and ate the food that was offered for Indra. <br/>
<br/>
2136. The devotees of the god of the gods who rests on the ocean<br/>
will not have any troubles<br/>
no matter what bad or good acts they have done— <br/>
they will be always his devotees.<br/>
Even if the messengers of Yama search for them <br/>
they will not be able to find them.<br/>
<br/>
2137. Who could see the wonderful lord?<br/>
People can only prattle his names. <br/>
Even though he was sitting on the lotus on his chest<br/>
Brahma could not see Kaṇṇan’s lotus feet.<br/>
<br/>
2138. When I was afraid<br/>
that I would experience the results of my bad karma, <br/>
I came to the divine feet of you with your beautiful garlands,<br/>
learned to say your mantra “Namō Nārāyaṇā!”<br/>
praised you and worshiped you.<br/>
<br/>
2139. O heart, rise and come,<br/>
let us carry lamps and flowers and worship him.<br/>
All the mantras and any sastras that you have learned<br/>
are only to worship the feet of Thirumāl.<br/>
There is nothing more than that. <br/>
Let us go to worship the feet of the lord. <br/>
<br/>
2140. If you want to remove the results of your bad karma, <br/>
other troubles in your life, sickness and sin, <br/>
your only refuge is Rāma<br/>
who opposed and fought Rāvaṇa in Lanka <br/>
and killed him with his bow<br/>
when that king of the Rakshasas <br/>
kidnapped his wife with a waist soft as a vine. <br/>
<br/>
2141. Nānmuhan seated on a lotus on the navel of Thirumāl <br/>
gave the Vedas to all the creatures of the world<br/>
surrounded by the oceans,<br/>
yet even he does not know the path to moksha. <br/>
Only Thirumāl knows that and he is the refuge for all. <br/>
<br/>
2142. The world, the end of the eon that destroys the world, ,<br/>
the matchless dark oceans, the hills,<br/>
fire in the world, , the wind and the sky<br/>
all were created only by Thirumāl with his wisdom. <br/>
<br/>
2143. The arms of the god resting on the snake Adisesha<br/>
hold the discus that killed the Asurans<br/>
when he went through the two marudam trees, <br/>
broke them and made them fall, <br/>
they killed the Asurans <br/>
when they came as beautiful kurundam trees,<br/>
and they conquered the seven bulls so he could marry Nappinnai. <br/>
They reached out to all the eight directions<br/>
when the lord took the form of a dwarf <br/>
and measured all the seven worlds and the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2144. My hands worship nothing but him. <br/>
My ears hear only his sweet words .<br/>
I will not think of any pleasure <br/>
except praising the sounding anklets on the feet <br/>
of the lord whose arrows never miss their targets.<br/>
Anyone should feel ashamed to desire any pleasure but that. <br/>
<br/>
2145. I do not desire the wealth of others or join with mean people.<br/>
I make friends only with good people.<br/>
I do not feel amazement at the deeds of any god but Thirumāl.<br/>
How could any bad karma come to me?<br/>
<br/>
2146. The lord stays far away and is hard for anyone to know. <br/>
If devotees worship the feet <br/>
of the dark-colored lord with beautiful eyes and a thousand names <br/>
they will not experience the results of their karma<br/>
and they will not go to cruel hell.<br/>
They will never, even for the shortest time, involve themselves in bad deeds.<br/>
<br/>
2147. The songs that the world learns when it wakes up, <br/>
the pāsurams of the Vedas that the Vediyars recite, <br/>
all things that the world recites, thinks, and worships <br/>
are the names of him with a discus in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
2148. Wise devotees look only towards him,<br/>
the beloved of Lakshmi seated on a beautiful lotus, <br/>
just as the rivers go toward the sea, <br/>
beautiful lotus flowers turn toward the sun, <br/>
and lives move towards Yama. ?<br/>
<br/>
2149. O lord, you stay in the sky,<br/>
you are on the earth,<br/>
you abide in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
and you are in the recitation of the four Vedas. <br/>
Who can know the milky ocean where you rest?<br/>
Who can know your power?<br/>
Who can know your form even in all the eons. <br/>
<br/>
2150. People say it is true that when you were a baby<br/>
you swallowed all the seven worlds and lay on a banyan leaf. <br/>
Where was that banyan leaf? <br/>
Was it in the ocean? Was it in the sky?<br/>
Was it on the earth?<br/>
Tell me, O god who carried Govardhana mountain <br/>
surrounded with groves.<br/>
<br/>
2151. Praise Thirumāl for as long as you can speak. <br/>
Worship him until your body leaves the world.<br/>
It is good if you worship him<br/>
adorning him with flower garlands, performing sacrifices, <br/>
reciting his names and saying mantras<br/>
and doing any other deeds you can as praise to him. <br/>
<br/>
2152. O strong heart,<br/>
even if I remain healthy without any sickness and old age<br/>
and rule the whole world for all the four eons,<br/>
I only want the love of the lord with a heroic discus. <br/>
<br/>
2153. My heart says, “Love the lord with a discus in his hands,”<br/>
my tongue says, “Praise and worship his divine arms,”<br/>
my eyes say, “See the lord without birth”<br/>
and my ears say, “Hear the fame of the lord, adorned with lovely ornaments.”<br/>
<br/>
2154. O heart!. <br/>
You may praise or blame him who is adorned with thulasi garlands,<br/>
you may admire him or scold him. <br/>
He is the flourishing water of the ocean, the hills, the wide sky,<br/>
the wind, the body and life of all creatures. <br/>
<br/>
2155. Shiva rides a bull and Thirumāl rides Garuḍa, <br/>
Shiva burned the three forts <br/>
and Māl split open the chest of Hiraṇyan, <br/>
Shiva wears sacred ash and our lord has a sapphire color,<br/>
Shiva has Shakthi for half of his body and Thirumāl has Lakshmi seated on his chest,<br/>
Shiva has long matted hair and Thirumāl is adorned with a large crown.<br/>
Shiva has the Ganges in his matted hair<br/>
and Thirumāl measured the world with his long legs. <br/>
May they both protect us. <br/>
<br/>
2156. If devotees worship him <br/>
they will not experience the results of their karma <br/>
and any troubles that come to them will go away. <br/>
If devotees meditate on him, they will not become old <br/>
and if they worship his feet, <br/>
they will find good paths in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
2157. If devotees follow good paths and worship the lord<br/>
they will be like the three faultless gods in the sky<br/>
and Thiruvenkaṭam of the wonderful lord <br/>
who measured the world and the sky<br/>
will give moksa to them. <br/>
<br/>
2158. All your troubles will go away<br/>
if you praise him saying, <br/>
“You stand in Thiruvenkaṭam,<br/>
you are seated in Vaikuṇtam,<br/>
you recline in Thiruvekka<br/>
and you walk in the beautiful golden<br/>
Thirukkovalur filled with ponds.”<br/>
<br/>
2159. O heart, rise. <br/>
We will take fresh flowers from a punnai tree, <br/>
sprinkle them on his feet, fold our hands <br/>
and worship him who rests on the thousand-headed snake Adisesha. <br/>
He killed the cruel crocodile to save the elephant Gajendra<br/>
when he called the lord for help. <br/>
Who will have any affliction if they worship him?<br/>
<br/>
2160. Who will blame the one who gives <br/>
and not the one who receives? <br/>
Did you not ask for three feet of land <br/>
and receive the boon with water poured on your palm <br/>
from Mahābali and did you not grow tall<br/>
as your beautiful ornamented foot touched the high sky?<br/>
<br/>
2161. A snake terrified of an eagle, his enemy, <br/>
ran to the ocean where you rest and asked for refuge,<br/>
and you, the dark colored Māyavan, the strong one,<br/>
helped it with your generosity. <br/>
Who could help like that except you?<br/>
<br/>
2162. When the gods fought with the Asuras and asked your help, <br/>
he churned the milky ocean with them <br/>
using Mandara mountain as a the stick and Vāsuki, the snake as a rope,<br/>
and he gave them the nectar that came out of the ocean. <br/>
Isn’t his name the weapon that saves from cruel hell? <br/>
<br/>
2163. O Venkaṭam, you are the hill where lord stays<br/>
who shot his arrow and killed Mārisan <br/>
when he came as a golden deer.<br/>
Women with sword-like eyes go there<br/>
to worship the lord with fresh flowers and garlands <br/>
carrying lamps whose brightness<br/>
hides the light of the stars in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2164. You rest on the ocean and you hurl your strong discus <br/>
at your Asuran enemies, killing them,<br/>
but you were born as Kaṇṇan <br/>
and with compassion you carried<br/>
Govardhana mountain with your arms and saved the cows.<br/>
You fought with the seven bulls <br/>
and conquered them to marry Nappinnai. <br/>
What heroic deeds you have done!<br/>
<br/>
2165. O lord, who knows your power?<br/>
You measured the world with your feet, <br/>
yet you found that same world so small <br/>
that you could carry it on your tusk <br/>
when you took the form of a boar<br/>
to bring the earth goddess from the underworld.<br/>
<br/>
2166. O heart, controlling your five senses, <br/>
you carry water and worship him in the proper way,<br/>
but do you know the place where he rests on the snake bed?<br/>
Do you know where his eagle flag is? Tell me.<br/>
<br/>
2167. O lord, you, the generous one, carried Govardhana hills <br/>
to save the cows and the cowherds from the storm.<br/>
As you stay with Lakshmi in the beautiful Thikkovalur temple,<br/>
do you stay at the entrance, in the middle or inside? <br/>
<br/>
2168. All countries worship him, knowing how<br/>
he threw the calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asuras.<br/>
Lock the doors of hell!<br/>
If the devotees worship his ankleted feet <br/>
they will not go there.<br/>
<br/>
2169. I look only for your divine feet,<br/>
I only sing your fame<br/>
and I worship only the golden feet <br/>
of you with a shining discus. <br/>
How could anything hurt me?<br/>
<br/>
2170. There is no one who can match my dear lord.<br/>
Since I have his grace how could anyone be equal to me?<br/>
The blooming dark kāyām flower is fortunate<br/>
to have the same beautiful dark color that he has.<br/>
<br/>
2171. O Mādhava, <br/>
Hiraṇyan thought that he had <br/>
the boon of not being killed by a man <br/>
and he did not want to worship your feet bowing his head to you. <br/>
Though he was as strong as you, you were able to kill him <br/>
taking the form of a man-lion.<br/>
<br/>
2172. He took the form of a boar and split open the earth.<br/>
If devotees do not remove <br/>
the darkness in their hearts and inside their bodies, <br/>
lighting up their wisdom everyday<br/>
and worshiping the feet of the lord, <br/>
they will not attain moksha.<br/>
<br/>
2173. O Thirumāl!<br/>
You are the sky, fire, the rolling ocean, <br/>
the wind, honey, and milk.<br/>
Was your stomach that contained the world before you spat it out<br/>
full when you swallowed the butter <br/>
that Yashoda the cowherdess churned and kept?<br/>
<br/>
2174. Carrying in your handsome flower-like hand a golden discus,<br/>
you split open the stomach of Hiraṇyan <br/>
when he came to fight with you <br/>
unsheathing his sword, as you opened your mouth wide<br/>
showing your teeth and terrifying him. Why?<br/>
Did you get angry at him to destroy his pride?<br/>
<br/>
2175. Māyavan showed the sages all the worlds he had swallowed,<br/>
opening his mouth wide and his eyes like fire. <br/>
My tongue will not praise any other except him.<br/>
even for a moment. <br/>
<br/>
2176. The words “Namō Nārāyaṇā”<br/>
that you say with your tongue without stopping <br/>
are the way to attain everlasting moksha.<br/>
Why is it that people cannot understand this<br/>
and go in wrong ways?<br/>
<br/>
2177. O heart, know and understand this well. <br/>
The beautiful eyed- Thirumāl is both dharma and sin. <br/>
He is the earth, the ocean with rolling waves, wind and sky. <br/>
Worship him.<br/>
<br/>
2178. Compassionate, you saved the elephant Gajendra<br/>
so he could live with his mate. <br/>
Didn’t the golden Ganges receive Thirumāl’s grace<br/>
before she flowed as a fiery river<br/>
into the spreading matted hair<br/>
of Shiva who wears vibhuti? <br/>
<br/>
2179. Even though both the divine Shiva <br/>
with a body that shines like gold and thick matted hair<br/>
and Neḍumāl who measured the world and the sky with his two feet<br/>
have two different forms<br/>
one is inside the body of the other. <br/>
<br/>
2180. O good heart, if the devotees meditate<br/>
on the faultless eternal lord of Thiruvenkaṭam, <br/>
he enters their hearts. <br/>
Understand that Thirumāl resting<br/>
on Ādisesha in the milky ocean <br/>
is in your heart. <br/>
<br/>
2181. O my heart, if you keep in your mind<br/>
the Māyavan, Kesavan adorned with cool thulasi garland, <br/>
who kicked Sakaṭāsuran with the same shining lotus feet<br/>
that measured the world, you will attain moksha.<br/>
<br/>
Mudal Thiruvanthadi ends.<br/>

<center><h3>
14. Second Thiruvanthaathi. Buthaththāzhvar (2182 -2281)</h3></center>

2182. My love for him is a lamp,<br/>
the oil in the lamp is my desire to worship him,<br/>
and the wick is my sweet mind that melts for him.<br/>
I light the shining lamp with my wisdom. <br/>
I composed this Thiruvandāthi for Naraṇan<br/>
in divine Tamil. <br/>
<br/>
2183. If you stay in a good place <br/>
and recite the names of Nāraṇan,<br/>
understanding him well with your wisdom, <br/>
the nature of the king of the gods is to give you<br/>
the privilege of being a god among the gods in the sky. <br/>
<br/>
2184. If devotees worship sprinkling fragrant flowers <br/>
on the feet of the god resting on the milky ocean,<br/>
they will enter the shining world of the ancient god of the gods <br/>
where only the gods in the sky can enter. <br/>
<br/>
2185. I string garlands with jewels, pearls,<br/>
diamonds and fresh flowers,<br/>
carry matchless beautiful lotuses, and worship the feet <br/>
of him on whose chest Lakshmi seated on a lotus <br/>
on the right side of his body.<br/>
<br/>
2186. You asked for three feet of land as a boon <br/>
from Mahābali at his sacrifice<br/>
and measured the world and the sky with your two feet. <br/>
O Neḍumal, you are colored like the ocean rolling with waves!<br/>
Who is able to know the power of your feet and speak of it?<br/>
<br/>
2187. If good-hearted devotees control their five senses,<br/>
do much tapas with love, sprinkle fresh flowers <br/>
and worship him reciting his names <br/>
they will see the ankleted feet of the ocean-colored god. <br/>
<br/>
2188. When he raised his ankleted feet <br/>
and fought with his enemies Namusi and others<br/>
with his heroic discus, <br/>
he scared them and made their minds burn. <br/>
O heart, worship happily his divine golden lotus feet. <br/>
<br/>
2189. When Putana took you in her lap <br/>
and gave milk from her beautiful breast saying, “Drink happily,”<br/>
you pretended to drink her milk and killed her. <br/>
Even though she came as a mother and gave milk to you, <br/>
you killed her because she had come to kill you. <br/>
<br/>
2190. Yashoda was not worried about giving you milk<br/>
from her breasts with love<br/>
even though she saw how you killed <br/>
Putana when she came and fed you milk. <br/>
Is even this ocean-encircled earth that you measured<br/>
equal to the love of that cowherd mother? <br/>
<br/>
2191. O lord, I think always of you <br/>
who kicked and killed Sakaṭasuran <br/>
when he came as a large cart<br/>
and protected the world.<br/>
You asked for three feet of land from Mahābali<br/>
and took over the whole earth and saved its people.<br/>
I worship you with my tongue, <br/>
sprinkling flowers on your feet.<br/>
The results of my karma are gone.<br/>
<br/>
2192. Many people worship the feet of other gods <br/>
and enjoy life only for a short time,<br/>
but they do not worship you to attain eternal moksha. <br/>
O Neḍumal with the color of the ocean rolling with waves,<br/>
who can describe the might of your feet? <br/>
<br/>
2193. If any of his devotes worship him will reach<br/>
the feet of him resting on the snake bed.<br/>
He treats everyone equally.<br/>
Even the bright sun that goes around the world, <br/>
Nānmuhan on a lotus<br/>
and Shiva with a forehead eye <br/>
worship the lord every day without ceasing. <br/>
<br/>
2194. When the large elephant Gajendra<br/>
went to the pond to pick up a beautiful lotus flower to worship him<br/>
he was caught by a crocodile,<br/>
and the lord came and saved him, killing the crocodile. <br/>
Wasn’t Gajendra saved and so he could reach the world of Indra, <br/>
because he worshipped the feet of the lord with a discus?<br/>
<br/>
2195. O ignorant ones, do not praise the people<br/>
of the world who perform many evil deeds<br/>
increasing their karma.<br/>
Recite the names of the lord who grew to the sky <br/>
and whose hands were extended in all the eight directions.<br/>
Wander as sages and go to all the temples <br/>
where he stays, worship him and become faultless. <br/>
<br/>
2196. Are these the things the lord enjoys— <br/>
driving the chariot in the terrible battle for Arjuna,<br/>
-chasing Marisan to catch him when he came as a golden deer,<br/>
losing Sita when she was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa<br/>
and resting on the beautiful snake bed Adisesha on the ocean?<br/>
<br/>
2197. When he enters someone’s heart<br/>
and a devotee locks him in it, <br/>
the lord may not know that he is imprisoned in the devotee’s heart.<br/>
If someone does not dig out a pond on a mound in a forest <br/>
and save the rain water, there will be no water to flow and nourish the fields. <br/>
Lock him in your heart. <br/>
<br/>
2198. Indra, the king of the gods, and Nānmuhan on a lotus <br/>
worshiped him and asked him to help them when they were in trouble. <br/>
Like them, Shiva with thick matted hair adorned with the crescent moon<br/>
went to Thirumāl, asked for his aid and received his grace<br/>
when the skull of Nānmuhan was stuck to his hand.<br/>
Who but our lord could have helped them all?<br/>
<br/>
2199. Thirumāl took the form of a dwarf<br/>
went to Mahābali’s sacrifice, grew tall<br/>
and measured the earth and the sky,<br/>
he took the form of a man-lion <br/>
split open the chest of Hiraṇyan with his claws, <br/>
and he swallowed all the seven worlds in the eon. <br/>
Did Thirumāl with beautiful eyes do these things to save the world?<br/>
<br/>
2200. When Sakaṭasuran came as a cart, you kicked it and killed him,<br/>
but that is not all you did. <br/>
You also threw the calf on the vilam tree and killed the two Asurans. <br/>
The world may blame you for breaking a cart or throwing a small calf,<br/>
but you only did these things to protect the world. <br/>
<br/>
2201. If your devotees do not sin or do bad deeds, <br/>
and only praise you<br/>
because they recite your name Narayaṇā without mistake <br/>
and understand your power, worshiping only you,<br/>
they will live happily. <br/>
<br/>
2202. Our lord, the beloved of Lakshmi, abides in the hearts of those devotees<br/>
who always think of him and worship him.<br/>
They have the good fortune of bowing to the feet of the lord <br/>
who took the form of a dwarf <br/>
and they will never go to cruel hell. <br/>
<br/>
2203. Didn’t the dark Gajendra, the large elephant with white tusks, <br/>
worship him with beautiful flowers and get what he wanted?<br/>
If someone wants to achieve something, <br/>
it will be easy for him if he truly tries like Gajendra.<br/>
<br/>
2204. The lord who threw the calf onto the vilam tree <br/>
and killed the two Asurans, <br/>
went to Mahābali's sacrifice in the form of a dwarf, <br/>
grew tall and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.<br/>
If devotees worship him and live following good paths, <br/>
he will give them a good life. <br/>
<br/>
2205. O good heart, he is happiness and sorrow in life.<br/>
He is the five senses and he is the wind, fire, water, sky,<br/>
the dark mountains, the ocean with waves and burning fire.<br/>
He is everything. <br/>
<br/>
2206. He, famed since ancient times, the creator of the Vedas, <br/>
praised by the gods in the sky, <br/>
went to Lanka angrily, fought with the Raksasas <br/>
and killed their king Rāvaṇa.<br/>
He has come to stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where bamboo plants grow on the cool slopes. <br/>
<br/>
2207. He rests on Adishesa on the ocean, <br/>
and in the Venkaṭam hills where his devotees <br/>
who have controlled their five senses, <br/>
their feelings and their minds come and worship him. <br/>
He gave the hills to the gods <br/>
so that they can come, live there and worship him.<br/>
<br/>
2208. My mind searches for Thirumāl CHECK<br/>
the god of Thiruvenkaṭam hills, <br/>
like a vine climbing on the wall <br/>
that grows towards the sky <br/>
looking for a stick to support it.<br/>
<br/>
2209. The ocean-colored lord<br/>
stays in Thiruvenkaṭam and in Thiruvarangam,<br/>
a place that is hard to conceive.<br/>
He split the mouth of Kesi when he came as a horse<br/>
and he is praised by all as the god of the gods, abiding in the hearts of all. <br/>
<br/>
2210. You shot your arrows and destroyed southern Lanka. <br/>
You killed Putana when she came as a mother<br/>
to give you milk from her breasts.<br/>
Yet even though your mother Yashoda saw all these heroic deeds<br/>
she was not afraid to give you her milk. <br/>
<br/>
2211. People say, “O ocean-colored Thirumāl!<br/>
You measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice, <br/>
became a boar and split open the earth<br/>
to bring the earth goddess up from the underworld, <br/>
churned the wide milky ocean, took nectar and gave it to the gods, <br/>
and made a bridge on the ocean <br/>
and went to Lanka to fight the Raksasas.”<br/>
<br/>
2212. If the devotees go every day in the morning taking fresh flowers <br/>
and worship the feet of the beautiful lord <br/>
who took the form of a beautiful boar<br/>
to bring back the earth goddess from the underworld, <br/>
they will see the lord’s shining form and be happy. <br/>
<br/>
2213. O Thirumāl, my heart is happy<br/>
seeing you and worshiping your feet.<br/>
I am happy to sing and dance,<br/>
and your conch and fiery discus are happy seeing me<br/>
when I worship you. <br/>
<br/>
2214. When I bow to the feet of the lord <br/>
adorned with many thulasi garlands,<br/>
my heart feels happy. <br/>
I praise the heroic one with my tongue <br/>
the god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where bamboo grows on the slopes.<br/>
<br/>
2215. As a dwarf you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali<br/>
and when he gave it, you measured the world and the sky with your feet. <br/>
I worshiped you lovingly with fragrant smoke and fresh flowers<br/>
and became your slave. This is my good fortune. <br/>
<br/>
2216. People say passion is sweet but water is sweeter.<br/>
O father, if people do not want passion or water<br/>
and only listen to your heroism <br/>
that will be the water that protects them. <br/>
<br/>
2217. Mean people can achieve fame only by doing mean deeds.<br/>
They know nothing.<br/>
O my heart, worship our Māyan <br/>
who swallowed the earth and spat it out <br/>
and be calm.<br/>
<br/>
2218. You created the four-headed god, <br/>
the creator of the Vedas<br/>
who stays on a beautiful lotus on your navel. <br/>
If we do not praise your divine feet and bow to you <br/>
we will have only trouble in all our births.<br/>
<br/>
2219. Do not think you have much wealth<br/>
and depend on it to make your life without trouble. <br/>
You should think Mādhavan is yours and keep him in your heart.<br/>
Reciting his names with your tongue is just like reciting the Vedas. <br/>
<br/>
2220. O ignorant people, <br/>
know how to praise the names of the good lord.<br/>
That is what the Vedas say.<br/>
If you follow what you have learned from the sastras that is good.<br/>
If you cannot do that, <br/>
just say the names of Mādhavan— <br/>
that is really the meaning of the Vedas.<br/>
<br/>
2221. Before Yama comes and throws his rope and catches you, <br/>
think of the names of the lord. <br/>
You know that real happiness is to worship the feet of the lord<br/>
with Lakshmi on his chest. <br/>
There is no other thing could bring you happiness <br/>
except to know the lord and worship his feet. <br/>
<br/>
2222. No one can enter the world of the gods just by wealth. <br/>
The only way to attain moksha is by his grace. <br/>
O heart, don't forget his sapphire-colored feet<br/>
that give moksha to divine sages. <br/>
Always meditate on his names. <br/>
<br/>
2223. I think of Thirumāl always. <br/>
If devotees worship and meditate on the wide arms of the lord, <br/>
they will not have any future births. <br/>
Just by worshiping him <br/>
the sages get all the happiness <br/>
that those receive who were born <br/>
to enjoy family life in this world. <br/>
<br/>
2224. He shot his arrows and cut off <br/>
all the twenty arms, ten heads and two feet <br/>
of Rāvaṇa and killed him. <br/>
The only good use of my arms is to worship <br/>
the feet of the devotees who worship his feet. <br/>
<br/>
2225. For good devotees, <br/>
the names of beautiful-eyed Thirumāl are a true help. <br/>
I will not consider those who forget him as human beings. <br/>
Keep in your mind the name Mādhavan, <br/>
the god of dharma, and recite his names—<br/>
that is the only good thing that you should do.<br/>
<br/>
2226. The lord of Thiruvenkaṭam<br/>
worshiped by the gods in the sky<br/>
is himself the Vedas<br/>
whose meanings are endless.<br/>
If devotees worship his feet<br/>
they will have no pride whether they are rich or poor. <br/>
<br/>
2227. The generous sapphire-colored lord<br/>
stays in Srirangam, Thirukkoṭṭiyur <br/>
and in his favorite place, Thiruvenkaṭam. <br/>
He is lord of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
and Thiruneermalai flourishing with abundant water. <br/>
<br/>
2228. Folding your hands with devotion in your heart, <br/>
worship him in the morning when you get up <br/>
and sprinkle flowers on the feet of him - <br/>
who took the form of a man-lion and fought with Hiraṇyan, <br/>
-measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice, <br/>
-swallowed the world and spat it out<br/>
and split open the earth to bring the earth goddess from the underworld. <br/>
<br/>
2229. O Thirumāl, you taught the sages all the four Vedas<br/>
and the sastras that teach morals.<br/>
Embracing Lakshmi on a lotus on your chest,<br/>
you stay happily on the beautiful Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
surrounded with beautiful large groves on its slopes <br/>
where bamboos grow. <br/>
<br/>
2230. O my heart! Praise him and call to him without fear, saying , <br/>
“You drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of Putana <br/>
as the seven mountains, seven worlds and the seven sounding oceans <br/>
were all shaken.” <br/>
<br/>
2231. I will call Thirumāl with his faultless names saying, <br/>
“You are the cowherd adorned with precious ornaments, <br/>
the Yādavan, the Māyavan, loved by all.”<br/>
In front of everyone I am calling Mādhavan with love <br/>
in the same way all the cowherds call him.<br/>
<br/>
2232. O heart, <br/>
Think of the feet of the lord who has the sapphire color of the ocean<br/>
and recite his wonderful names. <br/>
Worship the feet of him who churned the milky ocean <br/>
and gave nectar to the gods <br/>
<br/>
2233. The dark-colored one <br/>
with Lakshmi on a beautiful lotus on his chest<br/>
is the lord of dharma. <br/>
He sent the evil king Rāvaṇa<br/>
who fought valiantly with his sword <br/>
to the world of Indra, the king of the gods in the sky.<br/>
Who knows how he gives his grace?<br/>
<br/>
2234. I would go and worship the lord in Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where the blooming creepers think <br/>
that the thick hair of women<br/>
falling low on their backs<br/>
are small hills and cling on to it to grow.<br/>
<br/>
2235. O lord, you wish to stay<br/>
in the Venkaṭam and Thirumālirunjolai hills <br/>
surrounded with thick groves. <br/>
Like those hills, I make my heart your temple, <br/>
worship you and say, <br/>
"Do not leave my heart, for it is your young temple<br/>
and it is like the milky ocean for you.”<br/>
<br/>
2236. You are wise and carry a heroic discus.<br/>
In all my seven births I have never forgotten you— <br/>
and I have been mindful of you.<br/>
Give me your grace so I may plunge into the ocean of joy.<br/>
<br/>
2237. If one gazes at the grass growing on the shore of the ocean <br/>
and tells it to be shy, will it become shy?<br/>
(Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, shows her golden body<br/>
before our Thirumāl shows his dark body to us.)<br/>
OR Lakshmi shows the dark body of Thirumāl to us <br/>
before Thirumāl shows his body to us. <br/>
<br/>
2238. Praise him with your tongue<br/>
who embraces Lakshmi on his chest<br/>
and gives his grace to all. <br/>
Have you heard? Devotees from all the directions <br/>
praise the name of our lord and worship his feet, <br/>
because it is our right to praise him. <br/>
<br/>
2239. Because of my good karma,<br/>
Saraswathi stays in my good heart <br/>
and has taught me what to do.<br/>
She gives her grace and tells me, <br/>
“Just as margosa, even though it is bitter, gives good health,<br/>
the golden discus which the lord carries to fight his enemies<br/>
is only to only protect the world and the gods. <br/>
Praise his golden discus!” <br/>
<br/>
2240. I worship his devotees with my good heart <br/>
and no longer do wrong.<br/>
My evil thoughts have gone away <br/>
and I think only of his beautiful lotus feet,<br/>
meditate on him and worship him. <br/>
<br/>
2241. You do not have only one form.<br/>
A shining form is yours, <br/>
and the vast world says you have two forms.<br/>
See, if devotees know your ancient form<br/>
they will rule the world with justice.<br/>
<br/>
2242. People say that as a thief<br/>
you took the form of a bachelor dwarf,<br/>
went to king Mahābali and asked for three feet of land.<br/>
You measured the world with one of your feet <br/>
and raised the other foot and touched the sky, <br/>
as your arms extended to all directions.<br/>
How fortunate they are who described you like this!<br/>
<br/>
2243. I did not have the fortune of worshiping you,<br/>
and I did not receive your grace because I was not wise.<br/>
I only praised and worshiped you saying things which are not true.<br/>
O, bull of the cowherds! You broke the horns of the seven bulls <br/>
and conquered them to marry Nappinnai. <br/>
<br/>
2244. If I were to describe how our father<br/>
conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai<br/>
and how he poured his blood into Nānmuhan’s skull<br/>
that was stuck to Shiva’s hands and made it fall,<br/>
they would be long stories. <br/>
<br/>
2245. O Kaṇṇa, all the stories that anyone tells, <br/>
no matter what they are about,<br/>
are only about you and nothing else.<br/>
My heart wants to praise you. <br/>
You are the stories and the divine words in them. <br/>
Give me your grace so I may understand your stories. <br/>
<br/>
2246. I worship your divine body,<br/>
I bow to your beautiful lotus feet with love <br/>
and I worship you folding my hands. <br/>
I searched for you, my refuge,<br/>
and know that the best life for me<br/>
is to praise and live where you are. <br/>
<br/>
2247. See, O good heart,<br/>
this birth is what has happened to us. <br/>
If we praise the names of Nārāyaṇan <br/>
resting on the ocean on a snake bed,<br/>
that will be the way to avoid going to hell.<br/>
<br/>
2248. I saw his divine body in a dream, <br/>
his hands and the fiery discus that he carries <br/>
and found that he is the strength <br/>
that will remove the results <br/>
of my good and bad karma <br/>
and the troubles of my life.<br/>
<br/>
2249. He, the king broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam, <br/>
used big Mandara mountain as a churning stick<br/>
and the enormous snake Vasuki as a rope, churned the milky ocean,<br/>
and gave the nectar to the gods,<br/>
cheating the strong Asurans with sharp teeth.<br/>
<br/>
2250. Even the kings of famous countries <br/>
who ride horses have been devotees<br/>
of the lord for their seven births.<br/>
on whose navel Nānmuhan abides on a lotus, <br/>
<br/>
2251. The places of our heroic lord, <br/>
skilled in shooting arrows and conquering his enemies, <br/>
are the hearts of his devotees, <br/>
divine Srirangam, the cool milky ocean,<br/>
Thirukkaḍalmallai praised by devotees,<br/>
Thirukkovalur and Thirukkuḍandai surrounded with walls.<br/>
<br/>
2252. When the lord who rests on the poisonous snake Adishesa <br/>
raised his flower-like feet, grew to the sky and measured the world, <br/>
the conch in his left hand sounded loud and his shining discus<br/>
that conquers his enemies shot out fire in the sky. <br/>
<br/>
2253. The monkeys in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
enter the ponds where flowers bloom, bathe,<br/>
take flowers place them on his feet and worship him. <br/>
O heart, come, let us go there, recite his divine names, <br/>
place the flowers on his feet and worship him.<br/>
<br/>
2254. When the elephant Gajendra <br/>
with tusks like crescent moons and angry eyes<br/>
was caught by a crocodile,<br/>
our lord went to the pond, killed the crocodile and saved him.<br/>
I have decided to become his slave, <br/>
praising his thousand names <br/>
and placing fresh flowers on his feet every day. <br/>
<br/>
2255. I have received the fruit of all the tapas of seven births,<br/>
for I have composed a wonderful garland of Tamil pāsurams<br/>
and placed it at his feet. <br/>
I am fortunate to have written them in fine Tamil. <br/>
<br/>
2256. The lord colored like a cloud <br/>
stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where a male elephant dripping with ichor <br/>
plucks bamboo sticks, soaks them in honey <br/>
and gives them to his mate.<br/>
<br/>
2257. It is good for us to take the sandal paste from the hills,<br/>
precious ornaments, silk clothes,<br/>
and fragrant white jasmine flowers <br/>
and offer them at the feet of the wise ancient lord.<br/>
<br/>
2258. O good heart, if we worship the faultless lord<br/>
offering beautiful lotus flowers at his beautiful feet <br/>
and reciting his thousand names and praising him, <br/>
that is the only tapas we need to do. <br/>
<br/>
2259. When he grew, measuring the world and the sky, <br/>
Nānmuhan was the only one who had the fortune<br/>
of washing his golden feet with the water of the Ganges<br/>
and embracing and praising him with all his divine names.<br/>
<br/>
2260. When Rama’s mother Kosalai asked him<br/>
not to go to the forest he did not listen to her,<br/>
and when his wife Sita, soft as a flower,<br/>
told him not to go, he did not listen to her either. <br/>
Wanting only to obey his father’s order, he went to the forest. <br/>
The strength he showed then was equal to when he measured the world. <br/>
<br/>
2261. I have become his slave, love him<br/>
and think only of his divine lotus feet<br/>
lovely as lotuses dripping with honey. <br/>
The joy of worshiping his feet is sweeter <br/>
than the joy of seeing his form.<br/>
<br/>
2262. I saw Nārayaṇan in the day and in my dreams at night, <br/>
and again I saw him truly.<br/>
I worship the beautiful shining feet of the lord<br/>
who carries a discus smeared with flesh <br/>
and his bright form in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2263. Lakshmi with lovely long sword-like eyes <br/>
sees his divine form all the time as she stays on his chest.<br/>
Why does the earth goddess feel jealous of her?<br/>
The beauty of his form will never be reduced <br/>
no matter who sees him.<br/>
<br/>
2264. With my poor words I worship Thirumāl <br/>
whom the Vedas praise with their divine words<br/>
thinking that Māyan might somehow accept me <br/>
and give me a small bit of his grace. <br/>
<br/>
2265. The lord went as a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan<br/>
who had the boon that no one could kill him<br/>
and afflicted the gods, not obeying anyone.<br/>
It is like drinking nectar in this beautiful world <br/>
to worship his feet. <br/>
<br/>
2266. I worshiped him saying, <br/>
"He is nectar. He is honey.<br/>
He carries a discus. He churned the milky ocean,<br/>
got the nectar and joyfully gave it to the gods.”<br/>
I praised and worshiped the lord with a garland <br/>
of words sweet as nectar.<br/>
<br/>
2267. Poets cannot see him,<br/>
they can only praise him with garlands of words.<br/>
Even sages doing true tapas cannot see the cloud-colored god.<br/>
What kind of tapas I could have done that I see him now?<br/>
<br/>
2268. Do I know only today the feet of the lord <br/>
who measured the world?<br/>
When I was in my mother’s womb itself I knew him <br/>
and worshiped him with folded hands.<br/>
I know the power of my father, the god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur. <br/>
<br/>
2269. I know that the only way to reach our father,<br/>
the god of Thennarangam, is to leave family life<br/>
and think of him always. <br/>
If devotees follow the divine path, <br/>
they will not go to cruel hell <br/>
and the guarded door of the gods’ world will open for them. <br/>
<br/>
2270. Did you, who were angry with Kamsan, fought and killed him, <br/>
and fought with elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam and broke its tusks,<br/>
go to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf <br/>
and ask for three feet of land in ancient times just to take over the world?<br/>
<br/>
2271. Won’t I rule this world <br/>
and go to the world of the gods <br/>
and stay with them in the sky<br/>
if I go and worship lovely-eyed Neḍumāl of Thirumalai?<br/>
<br/>
2272. The ocean-colored lord who saved the Vedas<br/>
received a boon from Mahābali <br/>
and measured the world and the sky with his two divine feet. <br/>
If you worship him, he will give his grace <br/>
and you will not have to worry about hell.<br/>
<br/>
2273. Neḍumāl with a Garuḍa banner,<br/>
and is praised by the gods in the sky<br/>
killed Kamsan by kicking him with his feet. <br/>
If you worship him and praise his names<br/>
quickly you will find how to receive all that you wish.<br/>
<br/>
2274. Hell is cruel and if you collect bad karma <br/>
you will go to the most cruel of hells.<br/>
Before any such terrible thing happens to you,<br/>
worship without ceasing the lord with a conch in his hand <br/>
who split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird<br/>
and drank the milk of Putana and killed her.<br/>
<br/>
2275. My heart bows to his feet <br/>
and worships the cloud-colored god of beautiful Thiruppāḍagam, <br/>
who split open the chest of his enemy Hiraṇyan<br/>
and swallowed all the seven worlds, <br/>
<br/>
2276. O my heart, all the world praises<br/>
the sapphire-colored lord of Thiruvathiyur <br/>
who split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan, <br/>
swallowed all the earth at the end of the eon<br/>
and spat it out again to save it. <br/>
<br/>
2277. The highest lord of Athiyur who rides on an eagle<br/>
and rests on the ocean on Adishesa with diamonds on his head, <br/>
is the god of the three sacrifices and the Vedas.<br/>
He is the lord of Shiva who drank poison <br/>
that came from the milky ocean<br/>
and he is also our dear lord. <br/>
<br/>
2278. You, lovely-eyed Neḍumal, king of the gods in the sky,<br/>
abide, embracing Lakshmi on your chest, <br/>
in the temple of Kuḍamukku<br/>
resting on the ocean on thousand-mouthed Adishesa.<br/>
<br/>
2279. The lord who was born on the earth, <br/>
raised in a cowherd village as Nandan’s son,<br/>
grazed the cows, danced on a pot<br/>
and swallowed all the earth<br/>
stays in my heart<br/>
<br/>
2280 . Thirumāl with beautiful eyes went as a dwarf <br/>
to Mahābali’s sacrifice and measured the earth and the sky <br/>
with his two feet, making Mahābali his slave<br/>
as the gods in the sky sprinkled flowers on his divine feet <br/>
ornamented with sounding anklets and asked him for his grace. <br/>
<br/>
2281. O Thirumāl, Neḍumāl, Kaṇṇan, <br/>
adorned with a wonderful thulasi garland <br/>
and lord of the gods in the sky,<br/>
who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans,<br/>
my love for you has no limit.<br/>
<br/>

<center><h3>
15. Third Thiruvandādi – Peyāzhvār (2282 – 2381)</h3></center>

2282. I saw today the divine form of the ocean-colored lord, <br/>
his golden body adorned with jewels<br/>
that shone with the color of the bright sun<br/>
and the golden discus in his hands that fights in war <br/>
and the sounding curving conch. <br/>
<br/>
2283. Today I saw his ankleted feet <br/>
and now I will not be born again for seven births. <br/>
O Thirumāl with a mountain-like golden chest , <br/>
You are adorned with a cool thulasi garland,<br/>
and you embrace your beloved Lakshmi from the milky ocean.<br/>
I find you with love in my heart. <br/>
<br/>
2284. The ocean-colored lord stays in my mind<br/>
who, angry at his enemies on the battlefield, <br/>
fought with them and killed them. <br/>
His chest is adorned with thulasi garlands, <br/>
and he rests on a snake bed on the wide ocean and embraces Lakshmi.<br/>
He is the remedy that will save me from going to hell. <br/>
<br/>
2285. The feet of the lovely-eyed lord <br/>
who swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out, <br/>
measured the earth and the sky <br/>
and received a boon from Mahābali for three feet of land<br/>
are wealth, nectar and remedy for all. <br/>
<br/>
2286. The feet of the lord with a discus <br/>
who measured the world are lotus-colored, <br/>
his body has the color of the ocean that surrounds the world<br/>
and the brightness of his crown is like the sun on its chariot.<br/>
All these things make him beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
2287. It is lovely to see his ocean-colored body,<br/>
it is lovely to see him cross the world with his feet,<br/>
it is lovely to see Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus<br/>
and brought the Ganges to wash the feet of Thirumāl <br/>
after the lord took water in his hand<br/>
to get three feet of land from Mahābali<br/>
so that he could measure the earth and the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2288. O heart, come, let us worship the feet of the lord <br/>
who measured the world surrounded with dark ocean.<br/>
He rides on Garuḍa and flies around the groves. <br/>
He is hard for anyone to understand <br/>
and he is inapproachable for all.<br/>
<br/>
2289. O good heart,<br/>
let us worship him folding our hands<br/>
and recite his many names,<br/>
praising him and saying, “ Nārāyaṇā!”<br/>
May our eyes see only Kaṇṇan, <br/>
adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees <br/>
who swallowed all the worlds and spat them out. <br/>
<br/>
2290. His eyes and hands are like lovely lotuses<br/>
and he has beautiful lotus feet that measured the world. <br/>
The shining body of the lord has the color of a cloud, <br/>
the ocean and a precious sapphire.<br/>
<br/>
2291. If people praise the brightness, strength,<br/>
beauty, form, faultless family and all other things of the lord<br/>
with a beautiful white conch in his right hand<br/>
and if they recite his names, all goodness will come to them.<br/>
<br/>
2292. He is in the four Vedas that are recited by all<br/>
and he has the color of a waterfall descending quickly <br/>
and filled with honey.<br/>
He carries a sounding conch in his hands <br/>
and rests on the snake bed Adisesha on the milky ocean.<br/>
He is the knowledge of the learned ones <br/>
of the ocean of sastras.<br/>
<br/>
2293. Devotees who cultivate knowledge, <br/>
recite the Vedas well, control and close the door<br/>
to the feelings of five senses<br/>
and meditate on the beautiful ocean-colored lord<br/>
will see his nature every day in the world.<br/>
<br/>
2294. In ancient times <br/>
when Thirumāl went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf, <br/>
took water in his hands and asked for three feet of land <br/>
and received it, <br/>
he grew tall and measured the world<br/>
and his crown split the sky. <br/>
<br/>
2295. If devotees who have given up the desire to embrace women<br/>
learn the sastras and put their minds on the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam <br/>
praised by all the four Vedas<br/>
and worshiped in the sky by the gods <br/>
whose crowns touch the feet of the lord, <br/>
they will reach him easily.<br/>
<br/>
2296. Our father, resting on the ocean rolling with waves<br/>
on Adisesha whose head bears jewels,<br/>
came and stays in my heart<br/>
and I became his slave.<br/>
<br/>
2297. My father shining like a beautiful lamp<br/>
of red corals and precious pearls <br/>
born in the ocean rolling with white waves<br/>
stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi <br/>
embracing vine-like Lakshmi’s chest. <br/>
<br/>
2298. All the days I have lived in the past,<br/>
and the days I live in the present and the future<br/>
are good days if I constantly praise the lovely-eyed Thirumāl. <br/>
May my mouth praise him. <br/>
<br/>
2299. O Neḍumāl,<br/>
you went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,<br/>
asked for three feet of land, received it, <br/>
and grew to the sky and measured the earth and the sky.<br/>
Give me your grace so that all of my fears will go away <br/>
and I will be a slave to your feet in all my seven births.<br/>
<br/>
2300. He was born as a child and slept on the banyan leaf <br/>
at the end of the eon, and gave his grace <br/>
to his devotees who, without any faults in their minds, <br/>
sprinkled fresh flowers on his feet, <br/>
folded their hands, stood before him and worshiped him. <br/>
How could not give his grace to his devotees now?<br/>
<br/>
2301. O Thirumāl, you, the tall god with beautiful eyes,<br/>
swallowed all the worlds and spat them out in ancient times. <br/>
How could it have been difficult for you to measure <br/>
the earth and the sky with your two feet at Mahabali’s sacrifice? <br/>
O divine lord? Tell us all about it. <br/>
<br/>
2302. When the Asuran Vakkaran came to fight with our lord, <br/>
who is adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland<br/>
and carries a shining discus in his right hand<br/>
and a conch in his left, he killed the Asuran.<br/>
He will present himself in whatever form<br/>
people wish to think he has. <br/>
<br/>
2303. O heart, the beautiful gods in the sky adorned with crowns <br/>
sprinkle fragrant flowers on his feet and worship him,<br/>
and you, O devotees, should worship the lord the same good way<br/>
following the sastras, and with your hearts melting.<br/>
<br/>
2304. I worship his feet ornamented with golden anklets,<br/>
my mind enthralled with the lord<br/>
adorned with a thulasi garland swarming with lovely-winged bees<br/>
that make buds bloom when they blow on them.<br/>
<br/>
2305. O heart, worship every day the ankleted feet<br/>
of the lord with a beautiful shining discus in his hand.<br/>
He is the blowing wind, the wide earth,<br/>
the sky where clouds float, strong fire and the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
2306. O, heart, there is nothing wrong if you worship the lord <br/>
who swallowed all the earth and kept it in his stomach,<br/>
ate butter that lovely-haired Yasodha churned and kept, <br/>
conquered the seven bulls for Nappinnai, <br/>
and is praised by all the gods in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2307. The lord, adorned with a cool thulasi garland<br/>
and resting on beautiful-eyed Adisesha, <br/>
stays in my devoted heart<br/>
and in famous Kachi, Thiruvenkaṭam, Thiruvekkaa, and Thiruveḷukkaippāḍi. <br/>
<br/>
2308. How could they have any troubles<br/>
if his devotees reach and worship the dark ocean-colored lord, <br/>
the origin of everything, who churned the milky ocean<br/>
and rests on the sea on Adisesha?<br/>
<br/>
2309. The highest lord, our father resting on the snake bed, <br/>
drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,<br/>
fought the Bharatha war to help the five Pandavas,<br/>
and was spanked with a churning stick <br/>
by the cowherdess Yasodha when he stole the butter.<br/>
<br/>
2310. Without being afraid the cowherdess Yasodha <br/>
took and embraced dark-colored Kaṇṇan <br/>
and fed him milk after he had drunk the milk of the devil Putana <br/>
as a beautiful baby prattling with his sweet coral mouth. <br/>
<br/>
2311. Thirumāl adorned with a thulasi garland<br/>
and resting on Adisesha on the ocean<br/>
stays in Kudanthai surrounded by the sea, <br/>
in Thiruvenkaṭam, in my pure mind, in the divine sky, in Iṛaipāḍi <br/>
and in beautiful Pāḍaham where Vediyars recite the Vedas. <br/>
<br/>
2312. The lord who stays on the milky ocean <br/>
on the earless serpent Adisesha worshiped by all the four Vedas <br/>
and took the form of a man-lion and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan.<br/>
He shares his body with Shiva adorned with a snake in whose hair the Ganges flows.<br/>
<br/>
2313. Gopalan who broke the Kurundam trees and killed the Asurans<br/>
abides on Adisesha on the milky ocean, in Thiruvenkaṭam, <br/>
the cool sky, all the sastras, the mind of Lakshmi,<br/>
the hearts of the sages plunged in yoga<br/>
and in my heart. <br/>
<br/>
2314. O Thirumāl, it is true <br/>
that you swallowed all the seven worlds <br/>
at the end of the eon,<br/>
lay on a banyan leaf as a baby, <br/>
churned the milky ocean with Mandara mountain<br/>
and gave the nectar to all the gods in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2315. O heart, see!<br/>
The faultless lord who killed the Asuran Kamsan <br/>
stands in Thiruvezhukkai, <br/>
and recline- on Adisesha on the ocean. <br/>
Is he exhausted because he measured the world <br/>
at Mahābali’s sacrifice? <br/>
<br/>
2316. My eyes say, “I want to see him, I want to see him!”<br/>
Folding our hands, we sing his praise<br/>
and worship the shining golden feet <br/>
of the god resting on the ocean<br/>
whose golden body is adorned with rich shining ornaments<br/>
and a thulasi garland swarming with bees that sing. <br/>
<br/>
2317. The dark ocean-colored Māyan <br/>
who measured the world and the sky <br/>
with his two feet and rests on the cool ocean<br/>
carries a fiery discus in one hand, <br/>
and a white conch in the other,<br/>
and a heroic club, a bow and a shining sword. <br/>
<br/>
2318. I became the slave of the lord colored like the rolling ocean<br/>
who is inside and outside of all,<br/>
with shining jewels <br/>
and coral-mouthed Lakshmi on his divine chest.<br/>
<br/>
2319. Even though all forms in the world are his forms, <br/>
he can be compared only to himself.<br/>
Our lord, the Māyan whose form is tapas<br/>
is all the stars, burning fire, the eight directions, tall hills<br/>
and the shining sun and moon in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
2320. Our lord is in the hearts of all<br/>
who is the earth, the eight directions, <br/>
the Vedas, the meaning of the Vedas,<br/>
the sky, and the god of the Thiruvekaṭam hills <br/>
where pure waterfalls descend with a lovely sound.<br/>
<br/>
2321. O heart, the faultless lord,<br/>
the king who measured the world,<br/>
is in the hearts of all his devotees <br/>
and in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
with peaks that touch the sky <br/>
and waterfalls flowing with abundant water.<br/>
<br/>
2322. When the lord who carried Govardhana mountain <br/>
as an umbrella to protect the cows and the cowherds <br/>
measured the world,<br/>
his diamond-studded crown touched the sky,<br/>
his hands extended in all the eight directions,<br/>
his ankleted feet encircled all the thick groves of the earth<br/>
and his dress shone like lightning.<br/>
<br/>
2323. The sapphire-colored Kaṇnan who grazed the cows <br/>
and played the flute killed the Asuran when it came in the form of a horse. <br/>
When the lord was angry at Hiraṇyan, he took the form of a man-lion<br/>
and split open his chest with his sharp claws. <br/>
<br/>
2324. The lord who embraces the earth goddess on his chest<br/>
and fought with the angry elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam <br/>
and broke its tusks<br/>
swallowed all worlds into his stomach. <br/>
<br/>
2325. He is the world, the eon, the ocean<br/>
the shining sun and moon and red fire.<br/>
O heart, worship the feet of the lord happily, <br/>
whose pure golden crown shines with bright rays. <br/>
<br/>
2326. Thiruvenkaṭam where a strong bull elephant <br/>
fights lovingly with his mate<br/>
and wanders angrily, spilling pearls from its white ivory tusks<br/>
is the hill of the lord<br/>
who swallowed all the earth in ancient times.<br/>
<br/>
2327. When the lord churned the milky ocean <br/>
using Mandara mountain as a churning stick <br/>
and the snake Vasuki as the rope,<br/>
pulling the rope with the gods on one side<br/>
and the Asurans on the other,<br/>
the water rose up and touched the sky. <br/>
<br/>
2328. O lord with beautiful eyes, <br/>
when Mahābali promised to give you three feet of land<br/>
you took it and grew tall and measured the whole earth and the sky. <br/>
Adorned with a thulasi garland,<br/>
you split open the mouth of Kesa when he came as a horse. <br/>
You close the door of hell and save us so we do not enter it.<br/>
<br/>
2329. Didn’t you make Mahābali pour water on your hands <br/>
and promise to give you three feet of land <br/>
when you went to him as a dwarf <br/>
and measured the world and the sky with your two feet?<br/>
Didn’t you graze the cows?<br/>
Didn’t you split open the mouth of the horse?<br/>
And didn’t you go between the marudu trees and fight with Devasuran? <br/>
<br/>
2330. With curved conch in your hands, <br/>
you fought with your enemy Hiraṇyan and killed him,<br/>
you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali <br/>
took over the earth and the sky, <br/>
and you fought with seven bulls <br/>
to marry Nappinnai.<br/>
<br/>
2331. O Thirumāl, when the elephant Gajendra<br/>
was caught by a cruel crocodile in a spring filled with beautiful water, <br/>
you, the beautiful dark-colored Kaṇṇan<br/>
adorned with a shining jewel-studded crown and thulasi garlands,<br/>
killed the crocodile and saved the elephant. <br/>
<br/>
2332. He protected the cows and the cowherds <br/>
with Govardhana mountain when there was a big storm<br/>
and broke the marudam trees when Asurans came as those trees.<br/>
As Rama, he fought the Raksasas and burned Lanka.<br/>
He will give you moksha, the divine place where there is no sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
2333. The lord shot his arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees,<br/>
and he took the form of a dwarf, went to Mahābali and took over the sky and the earth.<br/>
When Ravana, the king of Lanka took Sita, ornamented with beautiful jewels,<br/>
our lord, as Rama, went to southern Lanka. fought with Ravana and killed him<br/>
and brought his wife back. <br/>
<br/>
2334. The lord who slept on a banyan leaf on the ocean <br/>
as a magic child at the end of the eon<br/>
swallowed the earth and the flood of water.<br/>
O heart, worship the feet of him <br/>
adorned with a cool thulasi garland. <br/>
<br/>
2335. The lord kicked Sakaṭasuran when he came as a cart,<br/>
went between the Marudu trees when the Asurans came as those trees,<br/>
breaking them and killing them,<br/>
and he took the form of a boar, split open the earth,<br/>
brought up the earth goddess and loved her. <br/>
The love that he has for Lakshmi <br/>
whom he embraces on his chest <br/>
is more than the love that he has for the earth goddess. <br/>
<br/>
2336. The lord with lovely long eyes <br/>
like lotuses swarming with singing bees<br/>
wears many jewels on his large mountain-like chest <br/>
so it looks like a dark cloud glittering with lightning. <br/>
<br/>
2337. We do not know<br/>
whether our god’s color is white, red, green or black.<br/>
If one thinks about it only Saraswathi, the goddess of art, <br/>
could equal the beauty of the god<br/>
who is the beloved of Lakshmi.<br/>
<br/>
2338. With beautiful Lakshmi on his chest <br/>
he is like lightning shining in the dark sky.<br/>
People should understand that worshiping the feet of the dark god <br/>
who rides on Garuḍa is the only devotion they need. <br/>
<br/>
2339. Know that the god who asked for three feet of land from Mahābali <br/>
and took over the world and sky with his cleverness<br/>
stays happily in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where a female monkey tells her mate sitting on a small hill, <br/>
“Catch the white moon and give it to me.”<br/>
<br/>
2340. I found the way to survive<br/>
worshiping the feet of the dear lovely-eyed sapphire-colored lord<br/>
adorned with long thulasi garlands that make him look <br/>
like a dark mountain on which a waterfall flows. <br/>
<br/>
2341. Our god blew his conch and conquered his enemies on all battlefields,<br/>
protected the cows from the storm with Govardhana mountain, <br/>
went between the Marudam trees and destroyed them,<br/>
broke the cart when Sakaṭasuran came in that form, <br/>
drank the milk of the devil Putana<br/>
and threw the calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans.<br/>
<br/>
2342. Just as Thiruvenkaṭam, the milky ocean and Vaikuṇṭam<br/>
are ancient temples where the lord stays, <br/>
now Thirukkaḍigai surrounded with flourishing groves<br/>
swarming with bees is the divine heavenly place of the young lord.<br/>
<br/>
2343. The lord who took three feet of land from Mahābali and measured the world<br/>
after receiving a promise from him with water poured on his hands <br/>
stays in Thiruviṇṇagaram, in Thiruvekka surrounded by ocean with rolling waves,<br/>
in Thiruvenkaṭam, in Maṇṇakaram, in Thiruveḷukkai filled with beautiful palaces, <br/>
in Thirukkuḍanthai in the south, <br/>
in sweet Thiruvarangam surrounded with groves dripping with honey <br/>
and in southern Thirukkoṭṭiyur.<br/>
<br/>
2344. My father, the god of Thirumalai<br/>
where waterfalls flow with abundant water <br/>
has only one form that combines<br/>
Shiva with his long jaṭa, shining golden mazu, <br/>
and a snake around his neck <br/>
and our Thirumāl with a tall crown, a discus, and golden thread.<br/>
<br/>
2345. Using the snake Vasuki as a rope <br/>
and Mandara mountain as a churning stick<br/>
he churned the milky ocean,<br/>
took nectar from it and gave it to the gods. <br/>
Is he so tired because of that<br/>
that he reclines in Thiruvekka, sits in Kānji <br/>
and stands in Thiruvaragam? <br/>
<br/>
2346. Our father who broke the tusks of the elephant <br/>
Kuvalayābeeḍam and killed it<br/>
went as a man-lion in the evening<br/>
and angrily split open the chest of Hiraṇyan<br/>
and protected Prahaladan, the son of Hiraṇyan. <br/>
<br/>
2347. The Asurans Madhu and Kaiḍava<br/>
were destroyed when Adisesha with jewels on his head <br/>
merely breathed on them. <br/>
If anyone becomes the enemy of the god <br/>
and their end will be like that of Madhu and Kaibadava. <br/>
<br/>
2348. The lovely lotus on the navel of the lord <br/>
thinks that the shining discus in his right hand is the sun <br/>
and the white conch in his left is the moon<br/>
and, confused, opens and closes at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
2349. The lord who threw the calf at the Vilam tree <br/>
and destroyed the Asurans<br/>
stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hills where a monkey <br/>
that plucks a fruit from a vilam tree, <br/>
sees his own shadow in the water of a spring,<br/>
thinks another monkey has his fruit <br/>
and extends his hands and asks the shadow monkey to give it. <br/>
<br/>
2350. Her mother says, <br/>
“My daughter sings the praise of Thiruvenkaṭam<br/>
whenever she thinks of any hills.<br/>
She wears thulasi on her dark hair thinking <br/>
that is the best thing for a chaste women to wear <br/>
and she goes to bathe in the large ocean every morning <br/>
thinking that it is the milky ocean <br/>
where broad-armed Thirumāl rests."<br/>
<br/>
2351. The elephant in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
who washes his teeth with his ichor, <br/>
washes his hands and legs with the water from the waterfalls, <br/>
and carries blooming flowers that drip honey <br/>
goes, sees and worships the heroic lord of Thiruvenkaṭam.<br/>
<br/>
2352. The lord who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans <br/>
stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
where an elephant, thinking that a cloud is an enemy elephant, <br/>
runs and tries to fight it and a yāḷi, seeing the elephant,<br/>
screams in anger and kills the elephant<br/>
as the sound echoes through the hills. <br/>
<br/>
2353. Our young lord stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hill <br/>
where the bamboo sticks that gypsy girls <br/>
with round bangles throw as they play, rise up to the sky<br/>
and release the shining moon from its curse. <br/>
<br/>
2354. It is the best thing for our tongues to praise him<br/>
who drove a chariot yoked to seven horses and danced on a pot.<br/>
To worship the feet ornamented with sounding anklets<br/>
of the god of Thiruvenkaṭam is a good thing for us.<br/>
<br/>
2355. He drank the milk of the breasts of cruel devil Putana <br/>
and made her fall to the ground,<br/>
but the cowherdess Yasodha took him on her lap<br/>
and fed him milk, keeping him at her breasts.<br/>
Isn't her love beautiful? <br/>
<br/>
2356. In the divine Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
where the blossoms of vengai tree spread their fragrance, <br/>
an angry tiger sees the rabbit in the floating white moon<br/>
against the red color of the sky, thinks it is a real rabbit <br/>
and becomes angry because it could not catch it.<br/>
-<br/>
2357. You do not need to stand on a hill, <br/>
plunge into water or stand near five sacrificial fires to reach him. <br/>
If you sprinkle flowers, folding your hands, <br/>
and lovingly worship the god of Thiruvekka, <br/>
all your bad karma will disappear.<br/>
<br/>
2358.The Raksasa Rāvaṇa who slept on the lap of Nānmuhan as a baby <br/>
and received boons from him, his grandfather, <br/>
carried a shining sword and fought with Rama, <br/>
and Rama cut off all his ten crowned heads <br/>
and made them all fall on the earth.<br/>
Rama's lotus feet are the refuge of us, his devotees. <br/>
<br/>
2359. We should not think, “Where is our refuge?<br/>
Where can we go? Are we going to be born again and again?”<br/>
Praise and worship the heroic lord <br/>
who destroyed the strength of his enemies with his discus—<br/>
he is our only refuge. <br/>
<br/>
2360. If devotees control their five senses <br/>
and keep in their minds <br/>
only the dark ocean-colored lord <br/>
with a fragrant thulasi garland on his chest <br/>
they will not be born again. <br/>
<br/>
2361. My heart tries to approach the divine feet of the lord <br/>
resting on the snake Adisesha<br/>
with a shining discus that conquers all<br/>
and who fought with Vānāsuran, riding on a jeweled chariot <br/>
and cut off his thousand arms. <br/>
<br/>
2362. O my firm heart, even though it is difficult to think of him, <br/>
think and praise him without worrying. <br/>
He is in you and will not move from there. <br/>
Why are you unable to know him.?<br/>
Why do you do not feel him?<br/>
<br/>
2363. If you want to be aware of him it is hard <br/>
and it is impossible for you to see him <br/>
even if he enters your heart. <br/>
Where can I go to see the lord, the king <br/>
adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees <br/>
and dripping with honey?<br/>
<br/>
2364. Even though people praise Māyan saying<br/>
that he is sweet, no one can see him,<br/>
yet the sweet ankleted lord, stays inside your heart<br/>
who became a dwarf, went like a thief <br/>
and measured the earth and the sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice. <br/>
<br/>
2365. People think of him and say,<br/>
“He is the meaning of the four Vedas<br/>
and he is in our hearts and we feel him,”<br/>
but who has seen the cool lotus-eyed Māyavan? <br/>
How could one describe him in their poems?<br/>
<br/>
2366. In their poetry, poets worship the lord,<br/>
describing the beauty of his form,<br/>
and the devotees hear them <br/>
and come to worship him in all his temples.<br/>
Even if the poets and the people of the world praise the beauty of the lord <br/>
who conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,<br/>
will their words be enough to praise his divine shining beauty?<br/>
<br/>
2367. Beautiful clouds that flash with lightning,<br/>
roaring with thunder, show the color of dear Neḍumāl,<br/>
and the dark sky where clouds float together <br/>
looks like his dark color also. <br/>
<br/>
2368. O lord ornamented with shining jewels<br/>
and a cool thulasi garland strung with bunches of flowers <br/>
that swarm with bees,<br/>
your body blooms like a flower and shines like an emerald,<br/>
and the evening sky has your color. <br/>
<br/>
2369. Worship the golden ankleted feet of the lord <br/>
who is adorned with a cool thulasi garland dripping with honey. <br/>
If you do not have doubts, saying, “This is good, this is bad.”<br/>
you will not collect more karma in future<br/>
and your past karma will go away.<br/>
<br/>
2370. The lord who plays sweet music on his flute<br/>
is the god of Thiruvenkaṭam<br/>
where gypsies plant millet seeds in the fields <br/>
that grow along with bamboo that rises and touches the sky. <br/>
<br/>
2371. When Thirumāl, adorned with a beautiful thulasi garland, <br/>
grew tall and touched the rivers in the sky with his divine foot <br/>
at the sacrifice of Mahābali as his silambu and his anklets rattled,<br/>
his eight arms hurt as they extended in eight directions <br/>
because the space of the whole earth was not enough for them. <br/>
<br/>
2372. The young lord swallowed the earth at the end of the eon, <br/>
drank poisonous milk from the breasts of the devil Putanā,<br/>
and when Yasodha the cowherdess tied him with a rope<br/>
because he stole butter, even though it hurt him<br/>
he did not get upset and kept quiet.<br/>
<br/>
2373. O heart, worship the ankleted feet of the dark-colored Māyan,<br/>
the unborn, divine one who was raised by Nandan, the chief of the cowherds. <br/>
As Kaṇṇan he fought with Vānāsuran when Anurudhan took Usha<br/>
and cut off his thousand arms. <br/>
<br/>
2374. Thirumāl swallowed all the worlds, <br/>
kept them in his stomach at the end of the eon<br/>
and slept on a banyan leaf as a baby on the flood.<br/>
Who knows what will happen to this world?<br/>
O heart! Keep the lord inside you. <br/>
<br/>
2375. I light the lamp of knowing and feel him<br/>
in my heart and keep him there. <br/>
The Māyan, standing, sitting and lying in different temples, <br/>
entered my heart and stays there always. <br/>
<br/>
2376. O heart, worship his divine feet and praise Thirumāl<br/>
who went to Hiraṇyan in the evening as a man-lion<br/>
and split open his chest with his sharp claws<br/>
as his blood flew all over. <br/>
<br/>
2377. As the gods in the sky bow to him <br/>
their jewel-studded crowns<br/>
mark the lotus feet<br/>
of the beloved of Lakshmi.<br/>
<br/>
2378. Could the gods <br/>
Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus on his navel, <br/>
Shiva with long matted hair,<br/>
and Indra, colored like a kānji flower,<br/>
ever be able to think of him in their hearts even for a moment? <br/>
<br/>
2379. The lord who is the snow-covered mountains,<br/>
the wide sky, the wind and light <br/>
killed the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse and protected us.<br/>
He will save us from Yama when he comes to take us. <br/>
<br/>
2380. Our refuge is the feet of the god of Aṭṭapuyaharam <br/>
who fought and conquered all his enemies <br/>
and killed the murderous crocodile with his discus <br/>
when it caught the elephant Gajendra. <br/>
<br/>
2381. The dark cloud-colored lord with a discus is always our refuge.<br/>
Our lord with a tulasi garland on his mountain-like chest<br/>
has lovely lotus eyes that shine like lightning in a dark cloud<br/>
as he embraces Lakshmi who is on a flower dripping with honey.<br/>

16. Thirumazhisai Alvar - Nāmuhan Thiruvandāthi. (2382 – 2477)</h3></center>

Nārāyaṇan created Nānmuhan. <br/>
Nānmuhan created Shiva. <br/>
O, heart! If we say this we will survive.<br/>
Praise the feet of the poet Thirumzhisai.<br/>
<br/>
2382. Nārāyaṇan created Nānmuhan<br/>
and Nānmuhan created the five-faced Sankaran.<br/>
I composed andadi poems praising him.<br/>
Learn and understand the deep meaning<br/>
of each of these pāsurams without omission.<br/>
<br/>
2383. People say if one searches for a god, <br/>
they will find only one god <br/>
whose greatness no one knows.<br/>
The search and the meaning of all things is the only our god. <br/>
If the sages desire to find the lord, his grace will help them.<br/>
<br/>
2384. Who knows the god resting on the milky ocean, <br/>
staying in Srirangam or sleeping on a banian leaf?<br/>
Who knows the one unique thing in the world, <br/>
the real truth for the gods in the sky as I know?<br/>
<br/>
2385. Every one knows the Ganges flows in Shiva’s matted hair, <br/>
and that he shares half of his body with his wife Girija,<br/>
but our dear lord, the real truth for the gods in the sky <br/>
is alone in this world, without any one sharing him. <br/>
I wish to praise him, the meaning of all words.<br/>
<br/>
2386. O dear mighty-armed Thirumāl, <br/>
you split open the chest of Hiraṇyan<br/>
who had received many boons.<br/>
Never defeated by any of your enemies,<br/>
you created the four Vedas in the world<br/>
and hold inside yourself all the important gods,<br/>
human, animals and plants.<br/>
<br/>
2387. The Jains are ignorant. <br/>
The Buddhists are tired of trying to spread their religion.<br/>
The devotees of Shiva are small people.<br/>
Those who do not praise the Māyavan, <br/>
Thirumāl, Mādhavan are not good people.<br/>
<br/>
2388. Whether it is today or tomorrow<br/>
or even a little time after, your grace is always with me. <br/>
I do not see refuge except you.<br/>
O, Nāraṇa, see, I am not without you,<br/>
and you are not without me. <br/>
<br/>
2389. O heart, there is no help for me except <br/>
the lovely-eyed Thirumāl who conquered Shiva and took his bow<br/>
and cut off the ten heads of the king of Lanka with his sharp arrows,<br/>
destroying the pride of Lanka. <br/>
<br/>
2390. Let us worship the beautiful feet of the lord of the world<br/>
who heard the request of Shiva, <br/>
poured water from the pot of Nānmuhan, <br/>
recited a mantra from the Vedas <br/>
and made the skull of Nānmuhan <br/>
fall from the palm of dark-necked Shiva. <br/>
<br/>
2391. Even Nānmuhan on a lotus <br/>
and Shiva with long matted hair <br/>
were not able to see the head or foot <br/>
of the lord with a golden body <br/>
resting on soft fire-spitting Adisesha.<br/>
How can we see him? <br/>
We can only worship him.<br/>
<br/>
2392. Fold your faultless hands <br/>
and worship our ancient Thirumāl,<br/>
adorned with a tall shining crown and thulasi garlands.<br/>
Let your mouth praise him. Let your eyes see him.<br/>
Let your ears hear him.<br/>
Bend your crowned heads<br/>
and worship him sprinkling cool flowers.<br/>
<br/>
2393. You made the sages who do not worship you<br/>
have many births, <br/>
you released the moon from his curse,<br/>
and you freed the elephant Gajendra from the mouth <br/>
of the terrible crocodile in the deep pond<br/>
and gave them both moksha.<br/>
<br/>
2394. O sages, you do tapas, make your bodies weak <br/>
as if they were small empty cages and you suffer.<br/>
You do not know the path that leads to moksha. <br/>
He, moksha, is the truth, the meaning of the ancient Vedas, <br/>
the most excellent thing for the gods in the sky,<br/>
Nārāyaṇan himself. <br/>
<br/>
2395. Nārāyanan, my ruler, saves me from entering hell. <br/>
If people listen to the teachings of other religions like Jainism <br/>
they will fall into hell <br/>
and the world will not praise them.<br/>
<br/>
2396. If you place flowers on his feet,<br/>
and praise and worship the highest lord of the world<br/>
worshiped by many gods,<br/>
you will find the way like Markaṇḍeyan<br/>
to whom our god gave life <br/>
when Shiva with the Ganges flowing in his hair <br/>
went with the boy to see the lord. <br/>
<br/>
2397. My heart always worships <br/>
the god of the gods who hid the bright hot sun <br/>
with his discus in the Bharatha war <br/>
and destroyed the many enemies of the Pandavas. <br/>
<br/>
2398. Shiva the lord of true tapas<br/>
taught the path of dharma<br/>
under the shadow of banyan tree<br/>
to the four Nāyanmārs in the last yuga.<br/>
He truly worshiped Thirumāl who measured the world, <br/>
rests on Adisesha on the ocean,<br/>
and rested on a banyan leaf as a baby at end of the eon. <br/>
<br/>
2399. If a devotee does a tapas worshiping him <br/>
who came in the form of a man-lion<br/>
and split open the chest of the Asuran Hiranyan with his sharp claws, <br/>
that devotee will overcome the benefit of any tapas <br/>
that his enemies have done.<br/>
<br/>
2400. You with a discus <br/>
destroyed the boons that Hiranyan <br/>
and other Asurans received doing tapas to Nanmuhan,<br/>
and you are pleased to protect and save us. <br/>
Since you are the protector of all creatures, <br/>
even a fly that worships you will go to Vaikuṇṭam.<br/>
<br/>
2401. You are the world. <br/>
and everything in the world abides through your grace. <br/>
You are the god of gods that one achieves by tapas,<br/>
the sacrificial fire, tall mountains, <br/>
the eight directions, the bright sun and the moon.<br/>
<br/>
2402. When you took the form of a man-lion, <br/>
did your cave-like mouth open and shoot out fire?<br/>
Did your round eyes become red?<br/>
Is this the beauty of the highest god of the gods in the sky <br/>
who took the form of a lion<br/>
that looked like blazing fire? <br/>
Is this the beauty that all saw?<br/>
<br/>
2403. He was born as a child,<br/>
he took the form of a fish,<br/>
and he has the nature of all the seven worlds. <br/>
When he, the seed that gives life to all,<br/>
came as a man-lion, he was beautiful.<br/>
You know him, and you worship his feet. <br/>
<br/>
2404. He fought and killed the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai. <br/>
Does one need to sow seeds to reach moksha<br/>
in the good land of the farmer, our lord?<br/>
The sky that pours rain has the color<br/>
of the divine body of the dark cloud-colored Thirumāl. <br/>
<br/>
2405. You have the colors of milk, gold, green and a dark cloud<br/>
and you fought with the two wrestlers and destroyed them. <br/>
You drove the chariot for Arjuna, <br/>
advised him to fight the Bharatha war bravely<br/>
and helped the Pandavas win the war. <br/>
<br/>
2406. It was not right for you to come as a dwarf, <br/>
cheat Mahābali, take his lands, <br/>
and destroy the pride of the king <br/>
who took a potion made of diamonds <br/>
and thought no one could conquer him. <br/>
What do you get by this sort of deed that destroys others?<br/>
<br/>
2407. You are the ocean colored Thirumāl.<br/>
Shiva with thick matted hair is my witness<br/>
that I do not want to worship anyone but you.<br/>
Give me your grace always<br/>
so I may know and worship only you. <br/>
<br/>
2408. O ignorant ones,<br/>
our Thirumāl has entered my innocent heart—<br/>
how can I worship any other god? <br/>
I tell you that I am able to see <br/>
the divine feet of him decorated with garlands <br/>
that even Shiva with the Ganges in his matted hair <br/>
could not to see. <br/>
<br/>
2409. See, this is the Sethu bridge <br/>
that he built to destroy the pride of Lanka. <br/>
See his power that killed Vāli, the monkey king. <br/>
See, his pride that destroyed with his arrows<br/>
Rāvaṇa, the king of Raksasas making his body tremble.<br/>
<br/>
2410. Our lord shot his one arrow<br/>
and killed Kumbakarnan with long eyebrows.<br/>
He will be happy if you praise him <br/>
whose form is brightness and joy. <br/>
<br/>
2411. The god of Srirangam <br/>
who rests on the flood on the snake bed Adisesha<br/>
stands, sit and reclines in my heart always<br/>
and saves me from all my troubles.<br/>
<br/>
2412. O, devils, Nāraṇan removed the curse <br/>
that Nānmuhan gave Shiva <br/>
and if you do not worship him,<br/>
the god of the gods in the sky where stars shine,<br/>
that is just the same as believing a story that is not true. <br/>
<br/>
2413. Even though it is a story <br/>
that when Thirumāl swallowed the world all the creatures survived<br/>
because he kept them in his stomach and protected them,<br/>
if someone does not praise him and doubts his power <br/>
how could he reach his feet and be saved?<br/>
<br/>
2414. The purpose of the lord who came to the earth <br/>
and grazed the cows was to kill Sakaṭāsuran,<br/>
to dance on the heads of Kālingan, <br/>
to catch the tusks of the elephant and kill it, <br/>
and to drink poison from the breasts of the devil Putana. <br/>
He fought with the seven strong bulls <br/>
to embrace the arms of Nappinnai <br/>
whose mouth is as beautiful as coral.<br/>
<br/>
2415. My aim is to praise the god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur. <br/>
and receive good life from him.<br/>
Will I ever hate the lord of Thiruveṇkaṭam?<br/>
I will worship his feet,<br/>
for he saves me from any sickness that I may have <br/>
and removes the results of my bad karma.<br/>
<br/>
2416. The divine one of Thiruvallikkeni, as beautiful as a peacock, <br/>
who rests on the five heads of the snake Ādisesha<br/>
where the large waves of the dark ocean roll and dash on the shores<br/>
is quietly lying now without opening his mouth.<br/>
Is he tired because he measured the world with his feet?<br/>
<br/>
2417. The ancient Neḍumāl<br/>
lovingly rests on the snake bed <br/>
in Kudanthai, in Thiruvekka, in Thiruyevvul, <br/>
in Srirangam and on the milky ocean.<br/>
If devotees embrace him, he will enter their hearts too.<br/>
<br/>
2418. The wind, the sky, the wide oceans, <br/>
the tall mountains, the hot sun that moves across the sky, <br/>
the cool moon, the clouds that float in the sky, <br/>
the eight directions and the earth <br/>
all flourish through the wish and grace of Thirumāl.<br/>
<br/>
2419. The ocean-colored lord <br/>
created six religions for the people by his grace.<br/>
If he becomes angry he will destroy at once any evil gods <br/>
who create troubles or do bad deeds. <br/>
<br/>
2420. She says, <br/>
“I call the god of Thiruvenkatam hills <br/>
where the large waterfalls descends like rain, bringing bright jewels, <br/>
and elephants are frightened when they hear the sound of the water<br/>
and snakes are scared and hide <br/>
when they see the brightness of the jewels. <br/>
I wish to see him and make a divine kuḍal to get his love.”<br/>
<br/>
2421. I praise Thiruvenkaṭam, the hill<br/>
that is my home and where I stay.<br/>
See, I always think of the lord of this hill. <br/>
I fell into the net that is the divine feet <br/>
of the beloved of Lakshmi, <br/>
the goddess praised by all the sastras.<br/>
<br/>
2422. O lord, you stay in my heart and in Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where the waterfall that descends scatters pearls <br/>
and roars as loud as the Onam festival.<br/>
I am anxious to go and see you in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.<br/>
<br/>
2423. Thiruvenkaṭam hill has the power to destroy his devotees’ karma. <br/>
Go and worship that tall hill that rises to the sky<br/>
where Nānmuhan on the fragrant lotus<br/>
and the three- eyed Shiva come and worship <br/>
the lotus feet of the lord. <br/>
<br/>
2424. Shiva wearing the crescent moon in his matted hair <br/>
and Nanmuhan on a lotus<br/>
enter in the night the northern Thiruveṇkaṭam hills <br/>
that touch the clouds in the sky and worship him,<br/>
offering him pearls and other things. <br/>
<br/>
2425. In ancient times when he was young,<br/>
with his toes he counted the ten heads of Rāvaṇa <br/>
who had a mighty army. <br/>
O young ones, go to the Thiruvenkaṭam hills surrounded with groves <br/>
where Kaṇṇan stays, remaining always young.<br/>
<br/>
2426. O, devotees, place flowers with love, <br/>
on the lotus feet of the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where a cool waterfall descends. <br/>
He is the refuge for the gods in the sky <br/>
and the people on the earth. <br/>
<br/>
2427. In Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
elephants raise their trunks to the sky<br/>
thinking they will touch the moon <br/>
and make it as a bright light for our lord Thirumāl,<br/>
and gypsies dance as they go around those hills,<br/>
bending their bows and trying to catch the elephants.<br/>
If people also will go around those hills and dance<br/>
that would be wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
2428. The Venkatam hills filled with aaḷis, lions, gold, jewels, pearls, <br/>
blooming trees, waterfalls that are mixed with many jewels,<br/>
forests, monkeys and hunters<br/>
are where the sapphire-colored lord stays.<br/>
<br/>
2429. Thiruvenkaṭam that removes the sufferings of karma <br/>
is the hill where the gods in the sky come and worship Thirumāl <br/>
and where our lord with the discus <br/>
abides, protecting the gods in the sky and killing the Asurans.<br/>
<br/>
2430. To praise the divine name of the wonderful god, <br/>
who churned the milky ocean <br/>
using Mandara mountain as a churning stick<br/>
and the snake Vasuki as the rope<br/>
is the only thing that all devotees should do. <br/>
<br/>
2431. Māyan is in my heart<br/>
and Yama will not come to me,<br/>
cruel karma will not come to me<br/>
and fire will not destroy me.<br/>
Kaṇṇan who rests on the water on the bank of Kaviri river<br/>
is in my heart that praises him. <br/>
<br/>
2432. O my dear lord colored like a kāyām flower, <br/>
there is no one to match you <br/>
except yourself, my only refuge.<br/>
Now that my mind has known you, <br/>
it will not be content even with the heavens,<br/>
for it understands you who are not understood by others.<br/>
<br/>
2433. Those of other religions who wear garlands of skeletons<br/>
will sell themselves for a price and beg for food.<br/>
If they do not worship our lord <br/>
who drank the poisonous milk of Putana,<br/>
they are ignorant and what they drink is dirty. <br/>
<br/>
2434. I will not worship any other god <br/>
except Rama, the destroyer of Lanka, <br/>
the land of the ignorant Raksasas. <br/>
Do not accept and worship evil gods<br/>
who are not divine and cannot give their grace.<br/>
<br/>
2435. All that a person has learned is a waste <br/>
if he does not worship Neḍumāl<br/>
the only god, the most ancient <br/>
of the all the three gods.<br/>
<br/>
2436. If people stand at the doors of some gods<br/>
worshiping their feet, they will be happy only at that time. <br/>
O Neḍumāl colored like the ocean rolling with waves,<br/>
how could they be capable of worshiping your feet?<br/>
<br/>
2437. Someone may say this one is god or that one is god,<br/>
but there is no one equal to the father of Kama, the beautiful prince.<br/>
Neḍumāl fought and conquered Shiva<br/>
who drank the poison from the salty ocean<br/>
and his escort when they came to help Vānanāsuran<br/>
and they all lost the battle with Thirumāl.<br/>
<br/>
2438. The lord himself is good karma and bad karma. <br/>
If I wanted to describe him <br/>
who killed the Asurans when they came as Kurundam trees,<br/>
I would say he is the stars, the gods, the Asurans <br/>
and he is in my heart.<br/>
Is there anything that he is not? <br/>
<br/>
2439. He measured the world in ancient times<br/>
as the king Mahābali saw his large form in terror. <br/>
He is in my heart and has removed all my troubles. <br/>
I give my love to the cowherd<br/>
who took away the curse of the bull-rider Shiva. <br/>
<br/>
2440. I am your devotee<br/>
and you are my love and sweet nectar<br/>
joy for me and everything else.<br/>
You, the beloved of the goddess Lakshmi <br/>
as beautiful as a golden statue<br/>
are my Kesavan, my shining light.<br/>
You protect me so that troubles do not come to me. <br/>
I am your devotee and your servant.<br/>
<br/>
2441. Devotees know that you will give moksha<br/>
to those who deserve it and they <br/>
approach you and worship your feet. <br/>
You are Rangan, a precious thing for the devotees <br/>
who worship you and ask for your help.<br/>
My mind will not stop loving you.<br/>
<br/>
2442. The lord, the ruler of the world<br/>
fought with the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai.<br/>
He is my treasure and I am with him. <br/>
If you ask Madhusudan, the refuge for all, for refuge <br/>
he will protect you<br/>
and you will not have any trouble in your mind. <br/>
<br/>
2443. The devotees of Thirumāl <br/>
wear thulasi garlands swarming with bees<br/>
as their god does. <br/>
They will tell the other ignorant ones<br/>
that the only god is Shridharan on whose chest Lakshmi stays.<br/>
<br/>
2444. I have spent all my time reading about you, <br/>
hearing about you, writing about you <br/>
understanding you, praising you, worshiping you,<br/>
and doing pujas for you who created the stars,<br/>
and rest on Adisesha, the snake on the ocean, <br/>
<br/>
2445. Real praise is to praise him only.<br/>
Place flowers at his feet<br/>
and worship the ancient god, the lord of the gods.<br/>
The mantra that destroys all seven births <br/>
is the names of Nāraṇan, the good lord.<br/>
<br/>
2446. I praise Thirumāl, Madhavan, <br/>
the mother of all with my poetry and in my heart.<br/>
Is there not a place in Vaikundam for me <br/>
who think always of him only? Tell me. <br/>
<br/>
2447. My heart is the place of Neḍumāl <br/>
resting on a snake bed. <br/>
I will not think that Shiva wearing the crescent moon <br/>
or Nānmuhan is equal to my god.<br/>
I will not serve them or worship them. <br/>
<br/>
2448. Even if I cannot circle the temple of god, <br/>
or am not from a good family, <br/>
if I praise the lord of the people Nāraṇan,<br/>
the god of wisdom with good words, <br/>
that will give me strength. <br/>
<br/>
2449. Yama calls his messengers and tells them, <br/>
“Listen to what I say. <br/>
There are people who do not worship <br/>
the divine feet of our god ever. <br/>
Even if they bow to you as if they were saintly people,<br/>
do not go away from them.” <br/>
<br/>
2450. Sweet to ears is the name of the lovely-eyed god<br/>
whose name is the refuge for all the people of the world.<br/>
I worship him, the full meaning of all poetry.<br/>
If one considers, the meaning of all the Vedas is only his praise. <br/>
<br/>
2451. It is not just today<br/>
that I have come to know the strength of the young lord, <br/>
who measured the world and the sky<br/>
and went to underworld as a boar, split open the ground <br/>
and brought up the earth goddess on his tusk.<br/>
<br/>
2452. The Māyan, the king of Dwaraka <br/>
who was born as a cowherd<br/>
is far away and is near, small and large.<br/>
Those who do not know <br/>
the words that the god said to Arjuna<br/>
will live in the world without any true knowledge<br/>
and will not be loved by others. <br/>
<br/>
2453. The proverb may say, <br/>
“If one has not had a family life, he cannot be a sage,”<br/>
but that is not dharma.<br/>
Good dharma, the four Vedas and tapas<br/>
are all only the god Nāraṇan himself. <br/>
Who can say this is not right?<br/>
<br/>
2454. Who can understand the power <br/>
of the god with a discus in his hand <br/>
who swallowed the earth and spat it out?<br/>
Dark-necked Shiva and eight-eyed Nānmuhan <br/>
could not find the god’s feet or head. <br/>
<br/>
2455. My tongue will not praise anyone<br/>
but the dark cloud-colored Māyavan <br/>
who gave his grace to the shining snake Sumugan<br/>
when it came and asked for refuge <br/>
because it was being chased by a hostile bird.<br/>
<br/>
2456. I will not praise any human with my tongue, <br/>
I will praise only the divine feet of the god of Vaikuṇṭam<br/>
whom fire-bearing Shiva with his red matted hair <br/>
comes and worships with flowers.<br/>
<br/>
2457. Songs, literature, stories, the Puranas,<br/>
fire, the large sky, the laws of Manu that all the world follows,<br/>
and the four Vedas are only the creation of Māyan’s māyā.<br/>
<br/>
2458. When the ocean-colored god <br/>
who built a bridge with stones over the wide ocean <br/>
wished to remove all my bad karma<br/>
even though I do not know all the things I have done wrong, <br/>
I worshipped him and all my sins went away. <br/>
<br/>
2459. When Shiva who burned Madan’s body was doing tapas<br/>
and Uma told him the name of Thirumāl, <br/>
the god adorned with garlands,<br/>
even Shiva’s tapas was disturbed. <br/>
What will happen to people if they really see Māl and worship him? <br/>
<br/>
2460. If devotees searching for Thirumāl <br/>
understand the ancient lord with love in their minds <br/>
and think of their bodies as a burden and wish to leave them <br/>
they will quickly go to Vaikuṇṭam. <br/>
<br/>
2461. When a terrible flood came in ancient times<br/>
Kaṇṇan protected the world and gave it his grace.<br/>
If you listen to the songs of this wide world<br/>
and dance and praise him, <br/>
that will save you from falling into a terrible hell. <br/>
and will open the door to moksha.<br/>
<br/>
2462. I thought that if I could open the door of my mind<br/>
and see you there, all my bad karma would go away.<br/>
You planted the seed of good Tamil in my heart and made it grow. <br/>
You became that language itself that I have learned.<br/>
<br/>
2463. The father of the beautiful Kama<br/>
has entered my heart and lives there. <br/>
Is there anything better than this could happen to me?<br/>
Shiva and Nanmuhan sprinkle fresh flowers <br/>
and worship the god, the king they cannot hope to equal. <br/>
<br/>
2464. The dark-colored god with a discus in his hand, <br/>
is the king of the gods in the sky, he is the sky, compassion,<br/>
the people of the world, our mother and all things.<br/>
He will give wonderful things to those who approach him.<br/>
<br/>
2465. I do not want any wonderful thing to happen to me. <br/>
I will not be a devotee of Shiva—<br/>
he will not be the right god for me.<br/>
I will only worship Kaṇṇan every day, <br/>
the king whose feet are adorned with sounding anklets.<br/>
Loving and worshiping him is my only duty.<br/>
<br/>
2466. If I have any other duties, they are merely vexations.<br/>
All I need is the time when I praise the names of Thirumāl,<br/>
the god with a bow, who destroyed the pride of Vaali<br/>
the angry, strong king of monkeys<br/>
and who abides in my heart.<br/>
<br/>
2467. See, my good heart, he is in you,<br/>
the Uthaman is always in you, <br/>
and if devotees think of him, he is in their hearts. <br/>
He, the matchless one, is the Esan <br/>
for those who are lonely, <br/>
and for devotees like me.<br/>
<br/>
2468. The lord ate the puja food served for Indra <br/>
in a pile as large as the majestic Himalayas,<br/>
he protected the cowherds from the storm, <br/>
he created all the religions, <br/>
and he protected the dark necked Shiva and Nānmuhan. <br/>
He is the life of the world. <br/>
<br/>
2469. When the messengers of Yama come and take someone’s life <br/>
our god is the one who will come and save him.<br/>
If devotees praise Thirumāl with songs <br/>
and think of him always, they will live happily. <br/>
The life of those who belong to other religions is a waste. <br/>
<br/>
2470. I know for certain<br/>
that to worship the divine feet of the god <br/>
resting on the milky ocean is not a mistake. <br/>
If devotees worship the god every day without unfailingly <br/>
the results of their karma will not come to them <br/>
and they will go to Vaikuṇṭam and stay there happily.<br/>
<br/>
2471. Those who want to go to heaven <br/>
will worship Thirumāl with flowers<br/>
and live a good life, <br/>
loving and serving others.<br/>
They are the real devotees of the lord. <br/>
<br/>
2472. I will sprinkle flowers on the lotus feet of all devotees,<br/>
and the feet of the gods in the sky, of Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus, <br/>
and of Shiva adorned with a snake,<br/>
and I will worship them and ask them <br/>
to give me their grace only so I may attain<br/>
the lotus feet of the dark-colored lord. <br/>
<br/>
2473 I do not ever forget Neḍumāl <br/>
who abides in my heart and will stay there for ever. <br/>
I am a devotee of Sridharan <br/>
with Lakshmi on his chest<br/>
and he has protected me from the time<br/>
I was in the embryo in my mother’s womb.<br/>
<br/>
2474. I never forget that he protects me,<br/>
I just say, “You are my Kaṇṇan” and stay quiet.<br/>
You, the king, give bodies and your grace to all lives.<br/>
You have the highest good nature. <br/>
If devotees understand what truth is <br/>
they will never leave you, the highest lord. <br/>
<br/>
2475. O god resting on the snake bed, <br/>
you destroyed the enemies of Pandavas <br/>
and helped them on the battlefield. <br/>
If you want, even neem leaves can be made<br/>
into a delicious curry. <br/>
Give your grace to me, your slave. <br/>
<br/>
2476. I, your slave, was born in a low family and suffered.<br/>
I do not want to worship gods other than you.<br/>
I want to reach heaven, <br/>
leaving this earth without my karma.<br/>
<br/>
2477. I know now the lord of Shiva and Naanmuhan.<br/>
I know you, my dear god.<br/>
I know you are the reason for all.<br/>
I know all I have learned is from you.<br/>
I know all I will be knowing is from you.<br/>
You are Nāraṇan and all your deeds are good. <br/>
I know that very well now. <br/>
<br/>
Nanmuhan Thiruvandathi ends. <br/>

17. Thiruvirutham. - Nammāzhvar  (2478 -2577)</h3></center>

2478. The poet says, <br/>
“O lord, chief of the gods in the sky,<br/>
hear the request of your devotee.<br/>
Remove my false knowledge, bad behavior,<br/>
and unclean body and give me your grace <br/>
so that I, born from my mother’s womb,<br/>
will not be born in this world again.”<br/>
<br/>
2479. Her friend says,<br/>
“She loves the cloud-colored Kaṇṇan, <br/>
the god of the gods in the sky.<br/>
Her eyes are filled with tears, <br/>
as if she were a fish <br/>
frolicking in the water of a flourishing pond. <br/>
May he prosper!”<br/>
<br/>
2480. She says,<br/>
“Worshiped by the gods, he wears a thulasi garland<br/>
and my lovely heart goes behind him as he rides on the angry Garuḍa,<br/>
carrying a fire-like discus that destroys his enemies.<br/>
Nappinnai, the beautiful daughter of the cowherds who play the flute,<br/>
the earth goddess and Lakshmi are with him like his shadow.<br/>
Will my heart stay there looking at his beloved wives<br/>
or will it return?”<br/>
<br/>
2481. She says, <br/>
“My lonely heart was attracted to his bird Garuḍa<br/>
and went behind it. <br/>
I have nothing to give to him who wears cool thulasi garlands. <br/>
O cool poisonous wind! <br/>
Is it right for you to blow <br/>
and make me shiver for the love I have for him<br/>
who drank milk from the breast of the devil Putana?”<br/>
<br/>
2482. Her friend says, <br/>
“The blowing of the cool wind is like fire,<br/>
it doesn’t seem to know it is the cool season.<br/>
Does he send it to make wide-eyed girls become pale?<br/>
Does the cloud-colored Kaṇṇan <br/>
make a rule for the wind to blow so cold?”<br/>
<br/>
2483. He says,<br/>
“This beautiful vine-like girl with sharp eyes like arrows<br/>
and eyebrows like bent bows <br/>
shot her arrow-look at me, her target. <br/>
She is like the god who rides on Garuḍa, <br/>
fought and conquered the Asurans,<br/>
and is like Yama himself, and she is like his son Kama the god of love. <br/>
Her love will take away your life. <br/>
Protect yourselves.”<br/>
<br/>
2484. She says,<br/>
“The wind blows, the rain pours down<br/>
and the clouds look like bulls fighting together.<br/>
The earth is cool and the sky has the dark color of Thirumāl.<br/>
Is this the rainy season that comes <br/>
to make lovers suffer in separation?<br/>
I don’t know. I have done bad karma.”<br/>
<br/>
2485. She says, <br/>
“All that I see and hear reminds me of my beloved, <br/>
the chief of the mountain. <br/>
I know that he wants to go far away, <br/>
crossing the large mountain of Thiruvenkaṭam,<br/>
to earn wealth, and it seems certain he will go.” <br/>
<br/>
2486. He says, <br/>
“Her face is like a lotus.<br/>
She has shining dark eyes and lovely lips,<br/>
her teeth are like white pearls,<br/>
her eyes are like beautiful blooming kuvaḷai flowers <br/>
and she looks like a beautiful doe. <br/>
She is divine like the sky world of the god <br/>
with a strong sharp discus in his hand. <br/>
Who could bear to be separated from her, <br/>
as lovely as a precious flourishing creeper?” <br/>
<br/>
2487. He says,<br/>
“O girls, you are as beautiful as the vines <br/>
in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills in the north where Māyon stays. <br/>
Even though I tell you how I suffer, you don’t listen. <br/>
Are your mouths as beautiful as thoṇḍai fruit?<br/>
Are you worried that if you speak,<br/>
the parrots that hear you will feel shy?<br/>
Tell me, I have done bad karma.”<br/>
<br/>
2488. He says,<br/>
“When I told her whose teeth are like white pearls,<br/>
‘You are like Kaṇṇan’s heaven. <br/>
You eyes are very special.<br/>
I need to be apart from you so I can gather wealth,’<br/>
her large eyes like kendai fish shed tears<br/>
and her precious golden body became pale. <br/>
Now, all these things keep appearing<br/>
and disappearing before me, making me suffer.”<br/>
<br/>
2489. She says, <br/>
“The pale color of my body increases.<br/>
The nights seem as long as eons. <br/>
My dear Kaṇṇan who has a beautiful discus <br/>
and is adorned with a cool thulasi garland <br/>
gave me all this pain <br/>
because his good heart loves me.”<br/>
<br/>
2490. She says, <br/>
“The sun, the king of the day,<br/>
the ruler of the earth with his scepter,<br/>
has set and the heat and the light have gone away.<br/>
The king of cold and darkness has come to rule.<br/>
The cool wind coming from the thulasi garland <br/>
of my beloved makes my bangles grow loose.<br/>
Who will protect me? The night grows like an eon.”<br/>
<br/>
2491. He says, <br/>
“Her beautiful fish-shaped eyes that are sharp like spears<br/>
have taken over my life.<br/>
The bright light of Kama’s divine arrows <br/>
will not leave me. They target my life.<br/>
She is like the divine heaven <br/>
of the shining dark-colored god.”<br/>
<br/>
2492. Her friend says, <br/>
“You came searching for an elephant and said to us, <br/>
‘You with fish-shaped eyes, did you see an elephant?’<br/>
If others find out that you came here, won’t they gossip?<br/>
We guard the millet field in Thiruvenkaṭam <br/>
of the lord colored like the ocean or a cloud.<br/>
You haven’t come for a while—<br/>
every day for a long time we have guarded the millet field.”<br/>
<br/>
2493. He says, <br/>
“You are as precious as the sky where Kaṇṇan stays.<br/>
When I am away from you, it seems as if many eons pass,<br/>
but the time I am with you seems very short.<br/>
Whether you are with me or away from me, <br/>
I become weak. <br/>
This darkness gives me much pain.”<br/>
<br/>
2494. She says,<br/>
“O ocean! You look like the darkness that is spreading. <br/>
May you prosper with your abundant waves. <br/>
The dark-colored lord resting on the snake bed Adisesha<br/>
shines like a black sun that spreads its rays and take away the darkness. <br/>
Do not erase the tracks of the wheels of the chariot on which my beloved rides.”<br/>
<br/>
2495. Her friend says, <br/>
“Does the sky look<br/>
as if it has taken its water from the ocean and risen,<br/>
or does the ocean look as if it has the color of the sky?<br/>
Is it the time of the eon when the flood comes<br/>
and he swallows all the worlds and the sky,<br/>
or it is just the rainy season?<br/>
The tears this girl sheds are like a waterfall.”<br/>
<br/>
2496. Her mother says, <br/>
“The dark clouds rise in the rainy season<br/>
and their thunder seems to scream out,<br/>
‘Is there anyone to protect the chastity of these women?’<br/>
If the lord adorned with a thulasi garland and riding on Garuḍa<br/>
does not give his grace soon enough, <br/>
the village will gossip about my little daughter<br/>
whose words are few.” <br/>
<br/>
2497. Her friend says, <br/>
“O Velan! She is not sick because her words are few. <br/>
Her sickness is not one that some young god has given—<br/>
it is only because she has fallen in love with our lord.<br/>
O Velan, stop your worship.<br/>
O mothers, hear my words.<br/>
Bring the cool thulasi garland from him <br/>
who swallowed all the seven worlds and put it on her.” <br/>
<br/>
2498. Her friend says, <br/>
“The gods in the sky bathe you in pure water, <br/>
adorn you with beautiful garlands <br/>
and burn incense to you and worship you. <br/>
You stole the butter in the cowherd village and ate it,<br/>
and you fought the seven bulls with bent horns<br/>
to marry Nappinnai, the daughter of the cowherd <br/>
and you danced the kuḍakkuthu dance.”<br/>
<br/>
2499. Her friend says, <br/>
“He wears a dress made of leaves<br/>
and in his hands he carries a bow and an arrow. <br/>
It seems he has come to hunt.<br/>
He asked us, ‘Did you see an elephant?’<br/>
He rides on Garuda and is a thief.<br/>
He asks things he can’t ask at his house.<br/>
Did our relatives tell us to go to the millet field <br/>
to answer naughty questions like this?”<br/>
<br/>
2500. He says, <br/>
“I have done bad karma. <br/>
My mind thinks of the millet field <br/>
where she is and the path to go there.<br/>
O girls watching the millet field,<br/>
are you like goddesses in the sky <br/>
where the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan stays?<br/>
Tell me, what are your divine qualities?” <br/>
<br/>
2501. Her mother says, <br/>
“Her beautiful fish-eyes shed tears like a river.<br/>
Does she suffer with love sickness?<br/>
She wants the garland of him<br/>
who rides on Garuḍa adorned with a thulasi garland dripping with honey<br/>
and carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella, <br/>
to protect the cows and the cowherds from the big storm. <br/>
What will become of the heart of my daughter ornamented with lovely bangles?”<br/>
<br/>
2502. She says, <br/>
“My bangles grow loose because I love the lord<br/>
the god of the gods and the god of Indra, the king of the gods.<br/>
His scepter that protects the sky and the earth<br/>
is bent because he does not want to help me. <br/>
I worry about the pain that his thulasi garland<br/>
may give to those who love him like me on this earth”<br/>
<br/>
2503. He says, <br/>
“The sun travels through all lands <br/>
and makes this desert so hot that no one can live here.<br/>
You, precious as gold,<br/>
have crossed into even this hot land with me.<br/>
Let us go to the temple in Thiruvekka <br/>
where the gods in the sky come to worship Kaṇṇan.<br/>
The beautiful, blooming grove near the temple <br/>
will take away our weariness<br/>
and make us feel good in this desert land.” <br/>
<br/>
2504. She says, <br/>
“The world says, <br/>
‘If someone receives the grace of the ruler, the protector of the world,<br/>
even enemies will become his friend.’ This is true. <br/>
I received the cool thulasi garland of Kaṇṇan and wear it,<br/>
and now even the cold wind that would blow like whistling fire <br/>
in the middle of every night makes me cool.”<br/>
<br/>
2505. She says,<br/>
“In Srirangam where you stay,<br/>
the Kaviri flows with abundant water.<br/>
There birds look to catch crabs<br/>
and the flowing water stops them and saves the crabs. <br/>
We want your cool thulasi garland<br/>
and are distressed that we do not have it.<br/>
The cool wind blows and makes us suffer more<br/>
and no one can escape from worry when their thoughts wander.<br/>
Give us your grace.”<br/>
<br/>
2506. She says,<br/>
“O swans that were born in good families,<br/>
go with your mates to the dark-colored lord<br/>
who shines like lightning and tell him, <br/>
‘We are her messengers.<br/>
She begged us to tell you how she loves you.’<br/>
Women do not go as messengers.<br/>
Aren’t you the right ones to go for me?”<br/>
<br/>
2507. She says, <br/>
“O swans and bees, I bow to you<br/>
and ask you to take my message to him.<br/>
Tell me, won’t you go to him? I won’t forget your help.<br/>
If you see other women Kaṇṇan loves<br/>
in Vaikuṇḍam tell them also about me. <br/>
Understand that helping me is the right thing for you to do.”<br/>
<br/>
2508. She says, <br/>
“O clouds floating in the sky with shining lightning<br/>
over hills as beautiful as pure gold studded with jewels,<br/>
You are going towards the place where he is<br/>
in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills that are known everywhere.<br/>
If I ask you to be my messengers, will you agree?<br/>
If I ask you to fly over me, <br/>
will you do that and go to see him?”<br/>
<br/>
2509. She says, <br/>
“O clouds, tell me, how did you get the good fortune<br/>
of having the color of the divine Thirumāl?<br/>
Did you do tapas to receive the grace of him who gives life to all?<br/>
Dark and filled with water,<br/>
you give rain to the world and make it flourish.”<br/>
<br/>
2510. Her friend says, <br/>
“You rest on Adishesa on the ocean <br/>
and rule this world with a scepter and your divine discus <br/>
and you take away the bad karma of the world<br/>
and the wide sky and give your grace to all. <br/>
Are you ignoring her, thinking she is just a woman?<br/>
Do you think she is a stranger?<br/>
We cannot understand what you are thinking,<br/>
but we see her growing pale and her beauty being spoiled.”<br/>
<br/>
2511. Her friend says,<br/>
“You are our Thirumāl.<br/>
Upset, she kicks and erases the kuḍal she drew on the sand<br/>
because it will not come together. <br/>
She loves you and wants your thulasi garland.<br/>
I don’t know how to help her and keep her from worrying so.”<br/>
<br/>
2512. She says, <br/>
“The evening, the woman of the west,<br/>
feels alone after the sun, her husband, has left<br/>
as she holds in her lap the moon, her son,<br/>
whose mouth is filled with milk.<br/>
The cool wind blows strong as if it wants to take away<br/>
all the grace that Thirumāl who measured the world<br/>
gives to those who long for his thulasi garland."<br/>
<br/>
2513. Her friend says, <br/>
“The night is getting dark <br/>
and the world looks as if the end of the eon had arrived.<br/>
She always prattles, saying, ‘cool thulasi garland,’<br/>
but our father who destroyed the forts in Lanka <br/>
surrounded with tall palaces<br/>
does not feel sorry for her suffering.<br/>
How could he be so cruel to her?”<br/>
<br/>
2514. Her mother says, <br/>
“Hunters live with arrows that kill animals<br/>
in the forest where my daughter went with him,<br/>
and there are other thieves there who steal cows. <br/>
Young people there beat their loud drums.<br/>
I have done bad karma.<br/>
My soft-waisted daughter, beautiful as a doe, <br/>
has gone away with Kaṇṇan, worshiping his lotus feet. <br/>
How could she walk with him in the terrible forest?”<br/>
<br/>
2515. She says,<br/>
“Did the neelam flowers do long tapas<br/>
as they grew in ponds with their strong stalks?<br/>
Is that why they have the color of him, the dancer on the pot <br/>
who measured the world and the sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice?”<br/>
<br/>
2516. She says, <br/>
“The dark-colored one , the protector<br/>
of good people and of the gods in the sky,<br/>
rules the sky and the world<br/>
surrounded by the ocean rolling with waves.<br/>
The lotuses that bloom in the ponds <br/>
on the dark hills look like the lord <br/>
with a dark body and lotus eyes.”<br/>
<br/>
2517. She says to her friends, <br/>
“O you ornamented with beautiful jewels!<br/>
The sun that is like a beautiful white elephant<br/>
sets in the evening and darkness appears like a herd of elephants.<br/>
When will the day come when my mothers<br/>
bring the thulasi garland of the beloved of the earth goddess <br/>
and put it on me to make me happy?”<br/>
<br/>
2518. She says, <br/>
“The terrible wind does not stop blowing.<br/>
There is so much heat, I don’t know what to do.<br/>
He who rides on Garuda and destroyed the Asuras<br/>
does not give his grace to me. <br/>
People gossip in the mandram in the village<br/>
and the cruel wind burns me.” <br/>
<br/>
2519. She says, <br/>
“He grew to the sky as if to say, <br/>
‘The distance between the sky and the earth is too small for me.’<br/>
My eyes that worship his feet <br/>
are like the soft lotuses in a pond waving in a strong wind.”<br/>
<br/>
2520. She says, <br/>
“His eyes and hands are like beautiful lotuses<br/>
and he has the color of a dark mountain. <br/>
Even the sages who know everything, <br/>
the gods in the sky and all others <br/>
cannot describe his beautiful color.”<br/>
<br/>
2521. She says, <br/>
“The sages and the scholars of religions <br/>
who try to find the paths of dharma may say, <br/>
‘This is the color, beauty, name and form of the highest lord,’<br/>
but he is only the light of wisdom <br/>
and no one really knows who he is, <br/>
or what his greatness is.”<br/>
<br/>
2522. She says,<br/>
“He gives his grace to us with his lotus eyes.<br/>
Is there anyone who can help us as he can<br/>
or any friend like him?<br/>
The bond between him and us is forever—<br/>
he is with us and we will have no trouble.<br/>
O heart, do not worry! Worship him and live.<br/>
O ignorant heart, only he can remove our births.”<br/>
<br/>
2523. She says, <br/>
“I thought my mind was my own<br/>
and there was no one closer to me than my own heart.<br/>
I thought my heart would help me <br/>
if I sent it as a messenger to him<br/>
who split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,<br/>
but it went to him and stayed.<br/>
It doesn’t want to come back<br/>
but wanders sweetly with him.”<br/>
<br/>
2524. Her mother says, <br/>
“My daughter fell in love with Kaṇṇan.<br/>
The wind from the north blows always and makes her suffer, <br/>
the moon pours down its rays and makes her hot<br/>
and her conch bangles grow loose.<br/>
She longs for his cool thulasi garland <br/>
and her body grows pale <br/>
because he hasn’t given it to her.<br/>
What will happen to my gentle daughter?”<br/>
<br/>
2525. She says, <br/>
“How can a worm moving so slowly with its soft body ever get to see the world? <br/>
I am just like that worm waiting to see him. <br/>
People have long believed that lizards can tell the future,<br/>
and this lizard tells me<br/>
that the beloved of Lakshmi will come to see me soon.<br/>
I hope that is true.”<br/>
<br/>
2526. She says, <br/>
“O friend with a shining forehead, <br/>
the dark-colored lord who wears thulasi garlands that swarm with bees<br/>
is Madhusudhanan, he is Damodharan.<br/>
I have not seen, heard or known <br/>
a darkness like the color of his body<br/>
that eclipses even the darkness of the night.<br/>
But it is not only his dark body—<br/>
this darkness of the night also makes me suffer.”<br/>
<br/>
2527. He says, <br/>
“O charioteer, drive swiftly. Don’t go slow. <br/>
I must go and see my beloved with shining forehead <br/>
before her pallor increases.<br/>
We should go to the wide Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
of the god of gods in the sky <br/>
where a waterfall shines like the pearl garland.<br/>
and falls to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
2528. She says, <br/>
“He, Māyappirān, churned the milky ocean using Mandara mountain<br/>
for a churning stick and the snake Vasuki for a rope<br/>
and he gave to the gods the nectar that came up.<br/>
The conch bangles I bought from the fishermen are becoming loose. <br/>
Does the ocean want to have them back because they belong to it?”<br/>
<br/>
2529. She says, <br/>
“The rain goddess takes the white waves of the dark ocean<br/>
and goes to him as he rests on a snake bed with Lakshmi.<br/>
The waterfalls make the hills <br/>
look like the breast of earth goddess <br/>
and then as they flow into rivers <br/>
it looks as if she were shedding tears and saying, <br/>
‘Tirumal is cruel!’”<br/>
<br/>
2530. The fortuneteller says, <br/>
“She fell in love with the god of the gods in the sky <br/>
and is sick with love for him. <br/>
Bring a thulasi garland or a leaf from it<br/>
or a beautiful branch of the plant or its root <br/>
and fan her with it.”<br/>
<br/>
2531. Sending bees as messengers, she says,<br/>
“O bees, it is easy for you to fly to the sky where he is. <br/>
Before you go to see him,<br/>
make sure you remember clearly the message that I give you.<br/>
Go to his faultless lotus feet and tell him. <br/>
The cowherd women scolded him <br/>
because he stole their butter and ate it,<br/>
but I won’t say anything like that.<br/>
Help me reach his faultless feet.”<br/>
<br/>
2532. He says, <br/>
“O bees! Come. You drink honey from the beautiful flowers<br/>
that bloom on the water, on the earth<br/>
and in the trees, and you feel happy and fly about.<br/>
I want to tell you something. <br/>
She is like the Vaikuṇḍam of him who took the form of a boar.<br/>
You drink honey from the fragrant flowers on her hair. <br/>
Have you ever seen such flowers anywhere else?”<br/>
<br/>
2533. She says,<br/>
“O friend! Through the divine grace of him <br/>
who swallowed the whole earth and spit it out<br/>
we have a place to live. <br/>
We are not afraid of anything.<br/>
The cool breeze brings honey <br/>
from his beautiful thulasi garland and sprinkles it <br/>
on my body and my ornaments. <br/>
No one around me knows this. <br/>
I am happy.”<br/>
<br/>
2534. He says, <br/>
“Her face is like a lotus,<br/>
her eyes are like beautiful kendai fish or sharp spears,<br/>
her nose is like a vine<br/>
and she wears earrings in her ears.<br/>
When our eyes met we felt as if we had drunk <br/>
the nectar from the milky ocean churned up by the gods.<br/>
No one will gossip about us—our love is true.”<br/>
<br/>
2535. Her friend says, <br/>
“When he took the boon from Mahābali, <br/>
one foot covered the whole world<br/>
and the other foot had to go to sky<br/>
since there is no space left on the earth.<br/>
He is the highest lord of the world and the sky<br/>
and he is the light of knowledge. <br/>
There is nothing left anywhere<br/>
for the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan to measure.”<br/>
<br/>
2536. Her foster mother says, <br/>
“She longs for the thulasi garland<br/>
of Madhusudanan, the lord of flourishing world,<br/>
and she, her lovely teeth like jasmine, cannot bear the pain <br/>
of the night that seems as long as an eon. <br/>
My daughter’s round breasts have grown pale. <br/>
I have done bad karma.”<br/>
<br/>
2537. Her mother says, <br/>
“My daughter’s breasts have not grown out yet,<br/>
her hair is not yet thick<br/>
and she doesn’t know how to put her clothes on. <br/>
She only prattles.<br/>
Her bright, mesmerizing glance is precious beyond any price.<br/>
She only knows to say, ‘Is he the highest lord?<br/>
Is Thiruvenkaṭam the hill where he stays?’”<br/>
<br/>
2538. Her friend says, <br/>
“O friend, how can we praise his might?<br/>
He is the highest and most ancient god of the gods in the sky<br/>
and all in the sky worship him. <br/>
He measured the whole earth and the sky with his two feet<br/>
without growing tired,<br/>
yet he came to the cowherd village <br/>
and was born as a baby there.”<br/>
<br/>
2539. Her friend says, <br/>
“You have the color of a cloud <br/>
and you rest on a snake bed on the ocean. <br/>
Even if she worships the ocean and asks it to be calm, <br/>
it just roars out, ‘aṟaiyoo!’<br/>
Her chastity cannot be saved without your divine grace. <br/>
Is this right, O lord?”<br/>
<br/>
2540. She says,<br/>
“He has a wonderful color<br/>
and his cool beautiful eyes shine<br/>
like lotuses blooming in the ponds in the sky.<br/>
I love the divine presence of Kaṇṇan, Thirumāl—<br/>
my heart thinks of him constantly without stopping.”<br/>
<br/>
2541. She says <br/>
“The Vediyars are like the gods in the sky<br/>
as they worship him reciting the mantras of the Vedas.<br/>
I blame myself for my bad karma and try to join him. <br/>
I have learned his divine names and recite them <br/>
but I am like someone who bites into a bitter unripe fruit <br/>
because he cannot get a ripe one.”<br/>
<br/>
2542. He says, <br/>
“Her flower eyes, more beautiful than a doe’s,<br/>
seem to talk to her ears.<br/>
She worships the feet of the god <br/>
who swallowed the whole world and spit it out.<br/>
Her divine eyes swallow me.”<br/>
<br/>
2543. He says, <br/>
“O friend, She is divine like the Vaikuṇṭam<br/>
of our god who is fire, water, wind, sky and earth.<br/>
Her eyes like kāvi flowers are my life. <br/>
Like the yogis who do not eat, sleep or have feelings<br/>
and put their minds only on god,<br/>
my thoughts are only on her.”<br/>
<br/>
2544. He says, <br/>
“She is like a swan with soft wings living in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where Mādhavan Govindan stays who rides on Garuḍa, <br/>
and conquered the Asurans.<br/>
Her eyes are like kāvi flowers, neelam flowers, spears and fish<br/>
and they are mighty enough to take away my life.<br/>
She is like a soft-feathered swan.” <br/>
<br/>
2545. He says, <br/>
“You are like Vaikuṇṭam of the god <br/>
who measured the earth surrounded with oceans. <br/>
Kondrai trees have begun to bloom<br/>
even though the rainy season has not arrived— <br/>
they seem to be inviting the rainy season <br/>
with their branches where long golden flowers hang.”<br/>
<br/>
2546. Her friend says, <br/>
“O you with your young breasts tied with a band,<br/>
don’t worry that even though night has arrived like a dark bull<br/>
he has not come. <br/>
He went to Mahābali’s sacrifice and took over the whole world—<br/>
Won’t he give his grace to you? Don’t worry. <br/>
You will not lose your bangles.”<br/>
<br/>
2547. She says to her friend.<br/>
“I long for the fragrant thulasi garland that is on the head<br/>
of the lord of the sky with a discus— <br/>
it will take away my pallor.<br/>
The darkness of night increases always for me <br/>
whether it is one day, one month, <br/>
one year or a thousand eons and makes me suffer.” <br/>
<br/>
2548. She says, <br/>
“O friend, I have never said<br/>
that he swallowed all the seven worlds at the end of the eon.<br/>
I saw the kaḷām fruit and said only it has the color of the ocean.<br/>
My mother heard and said,<br/>
‘She says this fruit has his color<br/>
who swallowed all the seven worlds.’<br/>
O friends, my mother thinks that I think of his color.”<br/>
<br/>
2549. She says, <br/>
“The crescent moon that splits the darkness surrounding the world<br/>
increases the pain of my love.<br/>
I am alone and my heart grows weak <br/>
longing for his thulasi garland.<br/>
The pale color of my body increases.<br/>
How can I survive with this bright moon?”<br/>
<br/>
2550. Her friend says, <br/>
“The white moon shines with milk-like rays <br/>
in the sky in the evening. <br/>
She suffers alone and her beloved, <br/>
the lord with the heroic discus,<br/>
the protector of all the seven worlds,<br/>
has not come to give his grace.<br/>
How could he not give his grace to her?”<br/>
<br/>
2551. She says, <br/>
“He knows everything in the world,<br/>
and he rests on his snake bed on the milky ocean<br/>
rolling with waves that come and go.<br/>
He swallowed all the worlds at the end of the eon.<br/>
and he carried Govardhana mountain<br/>
to protect the cows and the cowherds.<br/>
The fresh breeze that blows through his thulasi garland<br/>
comes and blows on me.”<br/>
<br/>
2552. He says, <br/>
“You have a shining face<br/>
and your eyes that are like keṇḍai fish spear through my heart.<br/>
Our lord rests on Adisesha on the ocean where conches roam and the smell of fish spreads.<br/>
Do you live in Vaikuṇṭam <br/>
where he lives, worshiped by the gods in the sky?”<br/>
<br/>
2553. She says,<br/>
“O innocent heart,<br/>
you yearn for the beautiful cool thulasi garland of the lord <br/>
who grew tall and measured the earth and the sky.<br/>
He makes the bright moon rise in the evening<br/>
when lovely lotuses close and soft ambal flowers open.<br/>
It is strange that my love for him<br/>
makes my conch bangles loose.”<br/>
<br/>
2554. She says, <br/>
“Evening has come<br/>
and the sun, the king of the day, sets after ruling the world <br/>
and the crescent moon rises slowly. <br/>
The thulasi garland of the god of the gods in the sky<br/>
who fought with the Raksasas in southern Lanka and destroyed them<br/>
appears before me, makes me pallid and hurts me.”<br/>
<br/>
2555. She says,<br/>
“I cannot describe the strength and ability<br/>
of the dark mountain-like lord who fought Vānāsuran<br/>
and cut off his thousand strong arms.<br/>
My innocent heart went to fetch his beautiful thulasi garland<br/>
and has not returned—<br/>
I am left only with the pain of my love.”<br/>
<br/>
2556. She says, <br/>
“The Vedas praise the lord <br/>
whose chest is adorned with a white thread.<br/>
The gods in the sky praise the endless one <br/>
who swallowed all the worlds at the end of the eon<br/>
and rests on Adisesha on the ocean.<br/>
Devotees of the whole world worship the god Sridharan, <br/>
and they are higher than the gods in the sky for me.”<br/>
<br/>
2557. She says, <br/>
“The sun sets like the kings who ruled the world <br/>
with their scepters for a time and disappeared.<br/>
You measured the world and you are the king of the sky.<br/>
Now, the darkness grows and gives us pain.<br/>
Do not leave us. Give us your grace.”<br/>
<br/>
2558. Her friend says, <br/>
“Don’t her mothers know what is happening to her?<br/>
They don’t know and they call the Velan to find out.<br/>
Didn’t they give birth to her?<br/>
Isn’t there anyone who knows<br/>
how to decorate her hair with a thulasi garland<br/>
and take her to the Thiruvengaṭam hills?<br/>
That is what she needs. <br/>
She is growing weak, suffering from the fire of love.”<br/>
<br/>
2559. She says, <br/>
“His eyes shine like two burning suns <br/>
rising from the tops of the hills <br/>
and they destroy and burn the Asurans.<br/>
Tell me, how is it that they burn us?<br/>
He protects the whole world—<br/>
he should not be hurting us like this.<br/>
Tell us, is this what he does to all the world?”<br/>
<br/>
2560. Her friend says, <br/>
“The male andril living in the cage on the palm tree calls his mate<br/>
and his cooing is like the viḷari raga. <br/>
My friend hears that and her life and body grow weak<br/>
and she continuously speaks his name.<br/>
I don’t know how she will survive.”<br/>
<br/>
2561. She says,<br/>
“You have the color of kohl<br/>
and you shine like a jewel.<br/>
You are a pearl. You are my diamond. <br/>
O dear one, I want to see you <br/>
among the beautiful girls at the festivals<br/>
holding your white conch <br/>
and golden discus in your hands.”<br/>
<br/>
2562. She says, <br/>
“The evening has arrived and the pure golden sun sets <br/>
like a diamond that a monkey has thrown down on the hill.<br/>
You are a diamond and you measured the world.<br/>
You are my emerald,<br/>
my matchless precious gold, my refuge.<br/>
I am apart from you in this evening.” <br/>
<br/>
2563. She says, <br/>
“The lord with a discus and a conch<br/>
helped Shiva when Brahma’s skull<br/>
was stuck to his hands and made it fall off. <br/>
When he stole butter Yashoda tied him<br/>
with rough ropes and beat him. <br/>
What can I say?<br/>
I can only prattle on praising my dear lord.”<br/>
<br/>
2564. Her friend says, <br/>
“The voice of the andril bird calling his mate<br/>
and the sound of the ocean flowing<br/>
with roaring waves in the backwaters <br/>
increase her lovesickness.<br/>
O Thirumāl, all these sounds make her suffer. <br/>
The world sees her suffering in love and gossips about her.<br/>
Is this how you play?” <br/>
<br/>
2565. She says, <br/>
“Meru mountain has a form like Thirumāl<br/>
and the bright sun is like the divine discus in his beautiful hands. <br/>
I have not seen his form or his discus,<br/>
but I prattle on as if I had seen him.<br/>
He has given his grace to me, his devotee, <br/>
and I will not experience the results of my bad karma.”<br/>
<br/>
2566. She says,<br/>
“When will I reach the lord, the beloved of Lakshmi,<br/>
nectar for those who have done good karma<br/>
and the destroyer of their bad karma?<br/>
Even though he only grazed the cows, <br/>
he is strong as a bull, <br/>
and he measured the world and the sky<br/>
with his two feet in ancient times.”<br/>
<br/>
2567. She says, <br/>
“I was born to worship you<br/>
whose discus destroyed the clan of Asuras. <br/>
I can only serve you with this body, <br/>
but I cannot reach your feet in this illusory birth.<br/>
I have been on this earth a long time,<br/>
O father, but I cannot reach you.”<br/>
<br/>
2568. She says, <br/>
“Like a thief the mischievous lord<br/>
stole butter from uṟi that was tied high on the wall,<br/>
swallowed all the earth in his stomach,<br/>
and went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf<br/>
and asked for three feet of land.<br/>
I am his slave. <br/>
My heart doesn’t want to love anyone but him.”<br/>
<br/>
2569. She says, <br/>
“The gods in the sky<br/>
worshiped your feet in the morning and evening. <br/>
and asked you to burn Lanka, the land of the evil Raksasas.<br/>
Did they worship you just to see you as Rama,<br/>
one of your many forms?”<br/>
<br/>
2570. She says, <br/>
“In the morning when the hot sun arrives <br/>
the wicked darkness runs away<br/>
and then comes back to spread in the evening. <br/>
The wise sages who worship the lord <br/>
closing their eyes and meditating<br/>
do not need to recite his praise or think of his dark form.”<br/>
<br/>
2571. His friend says, <br/>
“Only Vediyars are fit to worship your dark body, <br/>
with beautiful lotus eyes and divine feet.<br/>
The cows that return home in the evening<br/>
will call when they come near their stall<br/>
and the blind cow will call and follow their calling.<br/>
Just like them I, your slave, praise you with words.<br/>
I have not seen you. What else can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
2572. She says, <br/>
“The soul comes to this earth, enters a body, lives <br/>
and when the body grows old, it suffers and leaves this world.<br/>
I don’t want to be born—I want to be always with him.<br/>
I want to find some tapas that will take me to moksha<br/>
and remove the results of my karma.<br/>
He is my mother and father and can give me moksha—<br/>
I worship him to reach him.”<br/>
<br/>
2573. She says, <br/>
“You created many yugas, many gods and many religions,<br/>
and wise people worship the gods of those religions<br/>
and follow their teachings. <br/>
There is no other god like you. <br/>
If my mother calls the Velan and asks him about me, <br/>
I will not perform the rituals he asks me to do. <br/>
My love for you is the only true thing <br/>
and I will worship only you.”<br/>
<br/>
2574. She says,<br/>
“I have fallen in love with the lord<br/>
surrounded by many gods happily worshiping him<br/>
and for many days haven’t slept <br/>
as I have seen the sun rise and set.<br/>
Many eons have passed like this.<br/>
How could those who fall in love with Thirumāl<br/>
close their eyes and sleep?”<br/>
<br/>
2575. Her friend says, <br/>
“All the gods in the sky <br/>
and the sages and others who do not sleep<br/>
worship our matchless, omnipotent god.<br/>
He will remove their future births.<br/>
How can anyone understand how one so divine <br/>
could steal butter and eat it? Is it his magic?”<br/>
<br/>
2576. She says, <br/>
“People know that I am in love with him<br/>
who became a boar and brought the earth goddess<br/>
from the underworld at the end of the eon.<br/>
Let them gossip about me with mean words— <br/>
it doesn’t matter to me.<br/>
For Indra of the karpaga garden and the other gods <br/>
there is no other wise god like him.<br/>
I have not known any good thing but him.”<br/>
<br/>
2577. The poet says,<br/>
“Māran from Thirukkuruhur where good people live<br/>
composed a garland of a hundred pasurams <br/>
on the divine name of Thirumāl.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these pasurams <br/>
they will not have the results of their bad karma<br/>
and will not be born in the mire that is this false earth. <br/>

18. Nammaazhvar - Thiruvāsiriyam  (2578 -2584)</h3></center>
<strong> Praising the god </strong><br/>
<br/>
2578. O lord, with red garments, <br/>
your crown is the sun that spreads bright rays<br/>
and the beautiful moon floats above your head.<br/>
Your mouth is as lovely as coral <br/>
and you shine like a light and an emerald hill. <br/>
You are adorned with golden clothes <br/>
and many precious ornaments<br/>
and your mouth and eyes shine, <br/>
adding to the luster of your dark body. <br/>
You rest on thousand-headed Adisesha <br/>
in the middle of ocean with rolling waves<br/>
as Shiva, Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus on your navel, Indra <br/>
and all the crowd of gods worship you.<br/>
O lord, you measured all the three worlds <br/>
with your divine feet. <br/>
<br/>
2579. You, our father, created the world and swallowed it.<br/>
My heart longs to worship your shining lotus feet<br/>
ornamented with sounding anklets, melting to receive you.<br/>
My love for you flows like sweet nectar.<br/>
Some people wish only for material things,<br/>
never thinking of being your devotee—<br/>
let them do whatever they want.<br/>
The nature of this illusionary world is to become rich.<br/>
Even if someone gets everything he needs in this world <br/>
and excellent moksha, the wise will not want a worldly life.<br/>
Their only aim will be to reach your feet.<br/>
<br/>
2580. He, the first one of the three gods,<br/>
with shining jewels on his chest, rules all the three worlds, <br/>
leading them on a good path.<br/>
He churned the milky ocean using Mandara mountain <br/>
for a churning stick and the snake Vasuki for a rope,<br/>
and as the ocean was churned,<br/>
it roared with a a loud noise like thunder as its waves rolled. <br/>
May we serve the devotees of the matchless god <br/>
continuously, eon after eon.<br/>
<br/>
2581. Will he accept us as his devotees in all the eons<br/>
so that we may worship him?<br/>
At the time of terrible flood <br/>
when there was no world and no people, X<br/>
he, the seed from which everything came,<br/>
the only god at the end of the eon,<br/>
created Nānmuhan from his navel on a lotus,<br/>
and Nānmuhan created three-eyed Shiva <br/>
and the other gods and all the three worlds. <br/>
Let us worship the feet of Māyan.<br/>
<br/>
2582. Your eyes are like lotuses blooming in a forest,<br/>
your mouth is as sweet as a fruit,<br/>
your feet are like a thousand suns shining together<br/>
and your thousand divine arms<br/>
are like many flourishing forests of the karpaga garden. <br/>
When you put one foot on the earth and measured the whole world<br/>
and raised your other shining lotus foot to the sky and measured it, <br/>
the world created by Nānmuhan was amazed and pleased<br/>
and the gods in the sky performed their worship.<br/>
O Thirumāl! Can anyone measure the world<br/>
with their feet like this except you ? <br/>
<br/>
2583. Is this the nature of this world? <br/>
Some ignorant people worship small gods <br/>
and it is if they were worshiping a wooden plank <br/>
when they have a mother who gave birth to them.<br/>
When they have their own ancient first god <br/>
who created, split open, and measured the earth,<br/>
giving them his grace,<br/>
they do not worship him but they worship small gods<br/>
thinking that they are the real gods. <br/>
They offer them meat and then eat it<br/>
and do many wrong things, <br/>
worshiping in a way that will give them only sorrow. <br/>
As they enjoy their lives,<br/>
they are involved in the illusions of this world,<br/>
only to be born again and suffer again in life. <br/>
<br/>
2584. Shiva with the crescent moon in his matted hair,<br/>
Nānmuhan, Indra, the gods in the sky <br/>
and all the creatures of the world worship him.<br/>
At the end of the eon he swallowed the earth, ocean, fire, wind, sun,<br/>
moon, the sky and all other flourishing <br/>
and shining things in the world<br/>
and kept them in his stomach<br/>
as he, the divine Māyan, rested on a banyan leaf.<br/>
Is there any other god who is more divine for us to worship?<br/>
<br/>

19. Nammāzhvar’s Periya Thiruvanthādi. (2585 – 2671)</h3></center>

2585. O heart! <br/>
If you want to see him, get ready and come.<br/>
Let us go together<br/>
and praise with good words the divine nature and fame <br/>
of the god colored like a kāyām flower.<br/>
<br/>
2586. Sometimes we praise you <br/>
sometimes we blame you,<br/>
sometimes we do not praise you<br/>
and sometimes we do not blame you. <br/>
Sometimes we disrespect you. <br/>
sometimes we do not disrespect you,<br/>
O lovely-eyed Thirumāl, don't get angry at us<br/>
even though we have done bad karma. <br/>
Our lord, give us your grace. <br/>
<br/>
2587. Even though I know <br/>
which deeds are good and which are bad,<br/>
I do not have the power to control myself<br/>
to avoid good or bad deeds.<br/>
O lord, what can I do?<br/>
<br/>
2588. My heart has become a slave<br/>
to the dark shining ocean-colored Kaṇṇan. <br/>
If I think about it, I am most fortunate <br/>
and I have a good name. <br/>
Who could there be more fortunate than I?<br/>
<br/>
2589. You are my mother who gave birth to me<br/>
the father who taught me.<br/>
Whatever others taught me, it is of no use.<br/>
O dear Māyan who drank Putanā’s milk and killed her<br/>
when she came as a mother, show us a good way.<br/>
<br/>
2590. Will you show me the right path and guide me?<br/>
Will you show your tender dark body<br/>
to me, your innocent devotee?<br/>
Dear Kaṇṇan, tell me what you want to do with me.<br/>
Whatever you do to me, I will think it is for my good.<br/>
<br/>
2591. I have done bad karma and am far away from you.<br/>
My heart came to you to worship your feet.<br/>
You embrace Lakshmi, your beloved wife, on your chest.<br/>
You took the form of a boar <br/>
and brought the earth goddess from the underworld.<br/>
You are my beloved mother.<br/>
Keep me beneath your feet.<br/>
<br/>
2592. O good lord! We have not seen your feet <br/>
that measured the world<br/>
and we yearn to see you–tell us, why can we not see you?<br/>
You are subtle, impossible for sinners like us to see,<br/>
a match only for yourself. <br/>
<br/>
2593. We said to him again and again, <br/>
“We, your slaves, are suffering,”<br/>
but we still can’t approach him. <br/>
O heart, let whatever will happen happen.<br/>
Just live, thinking only of him. <br/>
<br/>
2594. Only the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, <br/>
twelve suns and two Ashvins<br/>
may worship him.<br/>
We are not worthy to worship him.<br/>
O good heart, we have done much bad karma.<br/>
<br/>
2595. You are the earth, the sky, the wind,<br/>
fire and the ocean. <br/>
You, mighty one, fought heroically with Rāvaṇa<br/>
when he opposed you and you killed him.<br/>
<br/>
2596. O heart, you immerse me in an ocean of sorrow,<br/>
and if I say you shouldn’t, what is the use?<br/>
Whatever I tell you, you don’t listen. <br/>
The only right thing is to worship the feet of Kaṇṇan.<br/>
<br/>
2597. What I am going to ask you is not strange.<br/>
O lord, if some devotee of yours asks you for something <br/>
that you may not want to give, <br/>
you will not lose anything by giving that to him. <br/>
This is what I want to ask you. <br/>
Show me your form.<br/>
However you wish, show me your shining body. <br/>
<br/>
2598. O heart, the devil Putanā<br/>
did not know the power of the dark god,<br/>
and gave her milk to him, but he killed her. <br/>
You know that if you fall into the enjoyments <br/>
of your senses they will hurt you, <br/>
but still you want to enjoy them and collect bad karma.<br/>
It is as if you were putting your hand into a snake pit.<br/>
<br/>
2599. O heart, know this. <br/>
The waves of the ocean roar<br/>
and strike his body and feet<br/>
as he rests on Adisesha. <br/>
If we praise his auspicious qualities, <br/>
it won’t give him any fame, <br/>
but our bad karma will all go away.<br/>
<br/>
2600. You, the good lord came as a dwarf <br/>
who was never born or raised on the earth<br/>
and asked for three feet of land,<br/>
measured it with one foot and took it.<br/>
You swallowed the earth at the end of the eon and spat it out<br/>
and you brought the earth goddess from the underworld.<br/>
The whole earth is yours,<br/>
so why did you ask for the earth from Mahābali as a gift?<br/>
Please tell us. <br/>
<br/>
2601. He carried his bow, fought with the Rakshasa Rāvaṇa<br/>
and cut off his strong mountain-like heads with his sword.<br/>
When devotees worship him and ask him for a boon,<br/>
whether he opens his mouth and says anything or not, <br/>
he gives them whatever they want and gives them life. <br/>
<br/>
2602. You are clever. <br/>
Whether you are tied up with ropes by Yashoda <br/>
or you rest on the snake bed,<br/>
you create all the creatures of the world always.<br/>
Who knows your true ancient form? Tell me.<br/>
<br/>
2603. O heart, you do not know any wickedness<br/>
and if you praise him, who protected the five Pandavas<br/>
night and day on the battlefield as they fought with the Kauravas<br/>
nothing bad will come to you.<br/>
If you want to see him, you can. <br/>
<br/>
2604. O intelligent good heart,<br/>
As a dwarf, he went to Mahābali’s sacrifice and measured the world,<br/>
and his body touched all the world. <br/>
We should be ashamed to think we can earn his grace. <br/>
The only way for us to get his grace is if he gives to us.<br/>
<br/>
2605. His body dark as a cloud,<br/>
he measured the world and the ocean with one foot<br/>
and raised his other foot and measured the sky. <br/>
His feet are in my heart<br/>
and I will not go to hell but be saved. <br/>
<br/>
2606. When Thirumāl entered my heart<br/>
the karma left that ruled me and made me suffer.<br/>
My bad karma shouts with sorrow as it runs away,<br/>
unable to find a place to stay.<br/>
<br/>
2607. O heart, he is the father and mother of all creatures<br/>
and will give us his grace and protect us when we are feeble<br/>
and the messengers of Yama come<br/>
bringing their dogs and make them bark at us. <br/>
O heart, do not worry, do not worry.<br/>
<br/>
2608. He is unique and there is no one equal to him.<br/>
He is in everything. <br/>
If he were to grow tired, <br/>
the whole world would turn upside down,<br/>
and then who could make this world<br/>
come back to the way it was?<br/>
<br/>
2609. People may do whatever they wish.<br/>
Who can change this wide earth?<br/>
Kaṇṇan, the god of the gods in the sky<br/>
gave his grace to me <br/>
and all the sorrows in my heart went away.<br/>
<br/>
2610. His beautiful body is like dark night. <br/>
His grace is like a club<br/>
that can hit and remove my bad karma. <br/>
I and my heart decided to cross the forest <br/>
and the hills of my bad karma by worshiping him. <br/>
<br/>
2611. Are you, tall Thirumāl,<br/>
happy because you measured the earth with your foot?<br/>
Are you happy because you measured the sky with your foot?<br/>
The whole world knows that you raised your ankleted feet<br/>
and measured the earth and the sky.<br/>
Am I someone who does not know your power?<br/>
<br/>
2612. Our eyes cannot see the dark form of the lord with a discus,<br/>
we can only feel him in our hearts, our inner eyes.<br/>
We should not feel that we are not seeing him<br/>
because he is in our hearts and that is where we can see him. <br/>
<br/>
2613. Our father adorned with a flourishing thulasi garland <br/>
is not easy to approach.<br/>
He shows as much as love to his devotees as they show to him.<br/>
I love him—my dear lord is easy for me to reach. <br/>
<br/>
2614. Lovely-eyed Thirumāl entered my small heart,<br/>
and from now on bad karma cannot stay there<br/>
because there is no space for it. <br/>
It is best if it leaves my heart and never comes back.<br/>
<br/>
2615. He put a pot on his head, danced <br/>
and then went to the wide ocean and rested on Adishesa.<br/>
We have found the way to remove our karma<br/>
and it is to know his grace and beauty,<br/>
approaching him and bowing to his feet<br/>
and staying in his shadow.<br/>
<br/>
2616. Damodharan wishes me to serve him,<br/>
but my heart would rather do evil deeds<br/>
and live a wicked life.<br/>
What can I do in this world to take away my karma? <br/>
<br/>
2617. The lord with a discus in his hand<br/>
smashed the deadly Asurans to pieces. <br/>
When we know him, we know it brings joy,<br/>
but then why we are not approaching him, <br/>
doing the good karma that leads us to him?<br/>
<br/>
2618. You, the ancient lord of justice,<br/>
shine with the dark color of the ocean.<br/>
I worship you and all my karma is destroyed.<br/>
When I hear of the beauty of you<br/>
as you rest on Adisesha on the ocean,<br/>
my legs become unsteady,<br/>
my heart suffers to see you,<br/>
and my eyes look for you everywhere. <br/>
<br/>
2619. He stands in Thiruvuuragam,<br/>
he sits in Thiruppāḍagam<br/>
and reclines in Thiruvekkaa.<br/>
He wanders everywhere, yet still, he is not satisfied. <br/>
The god who split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan<br/>
and loves all the creatures of the world<br/>
entered my heart and stays there, refusing to leave.<br/>
<br/>
2620. Do not wonder to yourself,<br/>
“Is he far away?<br/>
Is he near?<br/>
Is he in between?<br/>
Is he the god in the sky?”<br/>
If you accept Kaṇṇan <br/>
and give yourself to him<br/>
whoever you think god is<br/>
he will be the god for you.<br/>
<br/>
2621. O good heart,<br/>
We do not know what our future will be,<br/>
yet we may be able to know it<br/>
if we worship Thirumāl adorned with a thulasi garland<br/>
that swarms with bees.<br/>
Love and worship him and you will be saved.<br/>
<br/>
2622. O heart, do not worry about how to spend your time. <br/>
Think about the time Yashoda hit him and scolded him,<br/>
and even if you cannot do that,<br/>
speak about Māyan adorned with a thulasi garland.<br/>
Your karma will go away and you will be saved.<br/>
<br/>
2623. O heart, if you want to survive<br/>
you should do good deeds.<br/>
It is not enough only to praise him <br/>
with a fresh thulasi garland on his chest.<br/>
<br/>
2624. O heart!<br/>
There is no other opportunity for us like this one<br/>
to praise his power and fame.<br/>
You will not be pushed into cruel hell <br/>
if you worship him <br/>
who drank the milk of the devil Putana and killed her <br/>
when she came as a mother. <br/>
Praising him will give you true strength. <br/>
<br/>
2625. The wrestlers sent by Kamsan<br/>
thought they were stronger than you and opposed you,<br/>
but you cut off their heads with the discus in your hand <br/>
and killed them.<br/>
Do not stop doing your heroic deeds.<br/>
There are always Asurans like them in the world.<br/>
<br/>
2626. People say<br/>
“He swallowed all the worlds<br/>
at the end of the eon and spat them out,<br/>
he split open the world and went to the underworld <br/>
to bring up the earth goddess,<br/>
and he measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice with his foot.<br/>
He is the creator of the world and he is himself the world.”<br/>
If devotees know this, they will not worship any other god. <br/>
<br/>
2627. When the gods came to him asking for refuge<br/>
he took away their troubles and protected them.<br/>
How can the distress in the minds <br/>
of those who do not worship him be removed?<br/>
<br/>
2628. There are people who do not wish to praise him<br/>
who is adorned with a thulasi garland<br/>
even though their good hearts <br/>
and their tongues would like to. <br/>
Is that because they have done bad karma in a past life?<br/>
<br/>
2629. Afraid of the results bad karma will give me, <br/>
I will not do any bad deeds.<br/>
I will only praise the god of the gods <br/>
and bow to his golden feet.<br/>
<br/>
2630. The ocean-colored Thirumāl with beautiful eyes<br/>
is our refuge and will not leave us.<br/>
He protects us so we will not fall into cruel hell.<br/>
O heart, think always of him who is your only refuge—<br/>
this is the the best advice I can give you. <br/>
<br/>
2631. O Thirumāl, do not think that all people worship you <br/>
only to ask for material things.<br/>
You do not understand that wise ones ask only for your grace. <br/>
Where are those wise people<br/>
who think of you and receive your grace?<br/>
How many are there? Could I achieve what they have done?<br/>
<br/>
2632. We want to reach moksha,<br/>
above the world of the sky <br/>
and the only way we can achieve it is to worship you<br/>
who fought and killed the seven bulls with cruel horns<br/>
to marry Nappinnai with beautiful soft arms like bamboo,<br/>
<br/>
2633. Whenever I see clouds, a dark mountain, <br/>
the dark ocean, deep darkness,<br/>
puvai flowers always swarming with bees<br/>
or anything else that is dark-colored, <br/>
my heart, thinking it has seen his wonderful dark form,<br/>
leaves me and runs there. <br/>
<br/>
2634. My heart leaves me searching for where he is<br/>
without looking for anything else<br/>
and it runs behind anything with a dark color. <br/>
In his heart he does not feel sorry for me.<br/>
Does he who split open the mouth of the Asuran Kesi<br/>
when he came as a horse that have such a cruel mind? <br/>
<br/>
2635. The wicked five senses <br/>
control the mind, eyes, nose, mouth, ears and body.<br/>
The best thing for the devotees of the lord<br/>
adorned with a cool thulasi garland<br/>
is to control the feelings of the five senses<br/>
and worship the lord’s feet. <br/>
<br/>
2636. He took the form of a bachelor dwarf, <br/>
went to Mahābali, asked for three feet of land<br/>
and measured the earth and the sky.<br/>
He drank milk from the breasts of the devious Putana and killed her.<br/>
My eyes have only the desire to see him<br/>
and my mouth does not wish to praise anything but his fame.<br/>
<br/>
2637. O lovely-eyed Thirumāl, <br/>
I would tell you something. <br/>
You have given everything that your devotees want<br/>
and are waiting to know what else they may want.<br/>
Don’t you know that praising you <br/>
and keeping you in their hearts<br/>
is better for them than going to Vaikuṇṭam?<br/>
<br/>
2638. We worshiped him <br/>
who threw a calf at the vilam tree<br/>
and killed the two Asurans <br/>
when they came as a calf and a tree<br/>
and all the results of our karma went away,<br/>
we don’t know where. <br/>
Did they go to the sky,<br/>
or to the ocean whose rolling waves are blown by the wind?<br/>
Did they burn up in fire or go to the forest?<br/>
<br/>
2639. He rests on the ocean rolling with waves<br/>
on Adisesha who has a jewel on his head.<br/>
It is hard if you think he will come to you<br/>
but if you think of him always in your heart <br/>
he will enter it and take away the troubles in your mind. <br/>
<br/>
2640. There are no troubles in the lives of his devotees <br/>
after he has entered their hearts.<br/>
He came to the world in many forms,<br/>
as a cowherd, as a god in the sky<br/>
and as a dwarf who measured the sky and the earth<br/>
at Mahābali’s sacrifice. <br/>
He, the Māyavan, shows the way to all.<br/>
<br/>
2641. O heart, Thirumāl split open the heart of Hiraṇyan <br/>
and blood flowed like a flood from the Asuran’s chest<br/>
and he was destroyed. <br/>
Won’t he take away the results of our karma<br/>
and give us his grace?<br/>
<br/>
2642. O Thirumāl with a shining form,<br/>
I am plunged into your auspicious nature <br/>
that is as pure and sweet as milk.<br/>
Don’t change my life. <br/>
I don’t want to be born again<br/>
but come to you, stay beneath your divine feet<br/>
and serve you. <br/>
All I want is not to forget you. <br/>
<br/>
2643. As soon as I recited the names of the generous lord<br/>
who rests on the ocean with rolling waves<br/>
I thought my karma would go away <br/>
and hide in a forest.<br/>
Nothing like that happened.<br/>
Does my karma think it can still remain with me? <br/>
<br/>
2644. O my heart,<br/>
whether you think always of Māyan <br/>
adorned with a divine thulasi garland <br/>
and stay with him or not, it is up to you,<br/>
but there is no other god who can protect you<br/>
and save you from falling into cruel hell. <br/>
<br/>
2645. When we see the shining stars in the sky, <br/>
they look like flowers filled with pollen<br/>
strewn by the gods in the sky <br/>
as they recited the Vedas <br/>
and worshiped his divine feet <br/>
when he measured the world at the sacrifice of Mahābali. <br/>
<br/>
2646. The faultless sky is an umbrella that protects the earth,<br/>
the stars are like its shining decorations,<br/>
and the moon is its silver base. <br/>
When he grew tall and measured the world <br/>
he looked like a pole holding up the umbrella that is the sky.<br/>
He is the best remedy for all our troubles.<br/>
<br/>
2647. The highest lord with a divine discus in his hand, <br/>
cut off the nose and the ears <br/>
of the evil Raksasi Surpanaha in the forest <br/>
and then went to the ocean <br/>
rolling with strong waves to rest on Adisesha. <br/>
He looked like a dark cloud filled with water<br/>
blown by the wind as it floats in the sky<br/>
and then falls to the ocean. <br/>
<br/>
2648. He shot arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees<br/>
and he split open the mouth of Bāhasuran when he came as a bird. <br/>
If the gods in the sky know<br/>
that he is the highest god and know his heroic deeds, <br/>
won’t they fold their hands and worship him?<br/>
<br/>
2649. O heart, he will remove all the troubles that make you suffer. <br/>
Worship always with a garland of pasurams<br/>
Kesavan, Nāraṇan, Mādhavan<br/>
who wears a beautiful thulasi garland<br/>
and is strong as a mountain. <br/>
<br/>
2650. O heart, he is adorned with a cool fragrant thulasi garland<br/>
and he is the Vedas. <br/>
Know and worship Thirumāl, the Māyavan <br/>
who carries a heroic discus and took the precious life <br/>
of Rāvaṇa, the mighty Rakshasa.<br/>
<br/>
2651. O ignorant heart,<br/>
if you think you do not want to stay in this world <br/>
and want to go to the world of the gods, <br/>
he will give you that boon,<br/>
and if you say, “I want to stay in this world and rule it,”<br/>
he will give that also.<br/>
Learn only to worship and praise the feet of Kaṇṇan<br/>
and you will get what you want. <br/>
<br/>
2652. Does he wish to stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,<br/>
on the roaring ocean, in Vaikuṇṭam, or the world in the sky?<br/>
Or does he feel they are not fitting places for him?<br/>
O what is this strange thing! <br/>
Tall and dark, he entered the heart of me, his slave,<br/>
and does not want to leave it. <br/>
<br/>
2653. I praised the highest ocean-colored Thirumāl<br/>
and he gave me his grace and entered my heart.<br/>
The bad karma that was in my heart grew angry <br/>
and, red-faced and frustrated, left me.<br/>
No one can come and trouble me anymore. <br/>
<br/>
2654. He wears a precious golden crown,<br/>
carries a shining discus in his hand<br/>
and has a thousand divine names.<br/>
He is my father and mother <br/>
and I keep him in my heart— <br/>
he will remove all my troubles.<br/>
Whatever happens to me, I am not worried<br/>
because he will save me.<br/>
<br/>
2655. How can I describe your power?<br/>
Shiva with beautiful jaṭa <br/>
stays in the left part of your body<br/>
and Brahma stays on a lotus on your navel,<br/>
and there is no one to match you<br/>
who do not depend on anything.<br/>
<br/>
2656. Some say that you have three divine forms<br/>
and some say all three are one.<br/>
You have a matchless dark color, <br/>
you are the first god of this world <br/>
and you embrace Lakshmi on a shining lotus <br/>
on your chest.<br/>
<br/>
2657. Whenever I see<br/>
something with the color of the lord,<br/>
a puvai bird, a kayām flower,<br/>
a neelam flower or a kāvi blossom, <br/>
my soft heart thinks that they are his forms <br/>
and my heart and body feel happy. <br/>
<br/>
2658. O heart, he, the cowherd, <br/>
carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella <br/>
and protected the cows and the cowherds.<br/>
Even though I have pleaded with him continuously<br/>
telling him every day that I long to see him, <br/>
he does not take pity on me and appear before me.<br/>
Is my heart a big mound <br/>
keeping the flood of his grace from flowing over it?<br/>
<br/>
2659. You have swallowed the earth and the wide sky<br/>
and kept them in your stomach.<br/>
Through my ears,<br/>
you entered my heart and remain there.<br/>
You are inside me.<br/>
Who is better, you or me?<br/>
You carry a discus, smeared with flesh.<br/>
Think about it.<br/>
<br/>
2660. You have measured the world.<br/>
When I think of you my heart throbs.<br/>
If your grace touches my body,<br/>
I will be happy and feel <br/>
as if I have measured the world and the sky as you did.<br/>
Tell me, what will happen to me?<br/>
<br/>
2661. O father resting on the roaring ocean,<br/>
my relatives say they are very close to me,<br/>
but see, there is no one for me but you. <br/>
You are my only help in life <br/>
and the companion for whom I am thankful.<br/>
<br/>
2662. O good heart, you feel happy<br/>
that you have a large family, <br/>
an ancient lineage and other friends,<br/>
but none are permanent.<br/>
Praise the heroism of the lord <br/>
who shot arrows from his bow unceasingly <br/>
and conquered all his enemies.<br/>
That is how you will have strength.<br/>
<br/>
2663. Even those of low birth,<br/>
whose occupations are despised,<br/>
if they become the devotees of the god <br/>
with a discus in his beautiful hand<br/>
have no need to worry<br/>
about the results of their karma.<br/>
This world in which they were born <br/>
will be like the shining world of the gods for them—<br/>
there is no need for them to go to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
2664. Even if I have no births, no old age and sickness,<br/>
even if I am happy on this earth, <br/>
I will not want any of those things.<br/>
I think the days that I have not praiseed and worshiped him<br/>
who measured the world at Mahbali’s sacrifice<br/>
are all days of sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
2665. Whenever troubles come to me <br/>
he will take care of me whether it is night or day.<br/>
He does not think that I am bad<br/>
and do not perform good deeds,<br/>
that I am not fit to be his slave<br/>
or that I have no one to take care of me.<br/>
He rests on the flourishing ocean <br/>
giving his grace to me and taking care of me.<br/>
<br/>
2666. I have done bad karma and not knowing him<br/>
I have passed all my days in vain.<br/>
I did not follow and praise him <br/>
who carries a discus in his beautiful hand.<br/>
<br/>
2667. O heart, you do not want to do good things<br/>
and you are tired of the results of your karma.<br/>
See, I told you this. Find a way to save yourself.<br/>
I am worried about myself<br/>
He fought with the wrestlers and killed them.<br/>
The way you will be saved is to worship him.<br/>
<br/>
2668. O my heart, <br/>
I told you to bow your head, to strew flowers at his feet <br/>
folding your hands, worshiping him and praising him,<br/>
but you have not done that.<br/>
You have not asked him,<br/>
“Where did you go?”<br/>
Do not be like this without worshiping him. <br/>
Just worship him. That’s all you need to do.<br/>
<br/>
2669. The dark clouds take water from the ocean <br/>
and float in the sky.<br/>
Where did they go and what tapas they perform <br/>
to have the lovely dark color of the lord<br/>
resting on Adisesha on the milky ocean rolling with waves?<br/>
<br/>
2670. The lord with a body dark as a cloud<br/>
with a discus in his hand<br/>
swallowed the worlds and kept them in his stomach.<br/>
If people do not think of him or praise him<br/>
how can the the results of their karma be removed?<br/>
<br/>
2671. O my heart, whether it is now or another time, <br/>
if you always praise him who carries a discus<br/>
he will remove our karma.<br/>
Always praise his ankleted feet. <br/>

20. Thirumangai Azhvar - Thiruvezukuṛṛirukkai (2672)</h3></center>
This is only one Pasuram. <br/>
<br/>
2672. You created Brahma on a large lotus on your navel,<br/>
and you shot your fiery arrows and conquered and burned Lanka <br/>
surrounded with strong forts <br/>
around which even the sun and moon cannot move. <br/>
<br/>
You took the form of a dwarf,<br/>
a Brahmin bachelor dressed in deerskin, <br/>
wore a shining string on your chest <br/>
and went to Mahābali’s sacrifice. <br/>
You asked the king for three feet of land <br/>
and measured all the three worlds and the sky<br/>
with your two feet. <br/>
<br/>
Gajendra the elephant was caught by a crocodile <br/>
and you rode on Garuḍa with beautiful wings, <br/>
went to the deep pond with abundant water,<br/>
making all the directions shake,<br/>
and killed the crocodile <br/>
and saved the long-trunked Gajendra who dripped with ichor. <br/>
<br/>
You are worshipped by Vediyars<br/>
who do five sacrifices with three fires, <br/>
recite the four Vedas and do six deeds. <br/>
Your good devotees controlling their five senses<br/>
and removing desires, pride and egoism from their minds,<br/>
are rid of the good and bad karma that cause future births, <br/>
as they put their minds only on you. <br/>
You know the nature of those <br/>
who do not want to be born again.<br/>
<br/>
You keep in your body the three-eyed Shiva <br/>
who has four arms, is adorned with a snake, <br/>
and has the Ganges flowing in his matted hair.<br/>
He knows your power and worships you<br/>
who swallowed all the seven worlds <br/>
and kept them in your stomach.<br/>
<br/>
You are the six tastes-- sweet, bitter, sour, salty, astringent, pungent.<br/>
You carry six shining weapons in your hands,<br/>
have four arms and are colored like the dark ocean. <br/>
You rest on Adisesha on the ocean.<br/>
The Earth goddess and Lakshmi <br/>
who have beautiful moon-like faces <br/>
stay near your feet at all times of the day and caress them. <br/>
<br/>
You are the four Varṇas,<br/>
and the five elements–sky, fire, ocean, wind, and earth.<br/>
You fought and conquered the seven bulls <br/>
to marry Nappinnai whose hair swarms with six-legged bees<br/>
and lovely-haired Lakshmi stays on your chest. <br/>
All the six religions do not know who you are. <br/>
<br/>
You are the four things–dharma, wealth, pleasure and moksha,<br/>
and the three gods Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu,<br/>
and you, the giver of the results of good and bad karma,<br/>
are the unique god of rich Thirukkuḍandai in the south<br/>
surrounded by flourishing vines<br/>
and groves where flowers always bloom dripping with honey.<br/>
The Kaviri river flows there with its abundant water, <br/>
bringing precious jewels and leaving them on its banks,<br/>
and good paddy flourishes there in beautiful fields. <br/>
You are the god of Thirukkuḍandai<br/>
where the flags on the golden places <br/>
fly in the sky and touch the young crescent moon<br/>
and Vediyars worship you reciting mantras.<br/>
O highest lord, you rest on Adisesha,<br/>
the snake bed on the ocean<br/>
and you know all things. I bow to your feet.<br/>
Remove the results of my karma and my troubles.<br/>

21. Siriya thirumaḍal - Thirumangaiyāzhvār   (2673 to 2712)</h3></center>
<br/>
Numbers of the Pasurams in this section follows  Venkataraghavan’s text and is divided into  40 Pasurams. <br/>
<br/>
The earth goddess <br/>
<br/>
1. This world says, <br/>
“Hills covered with clouds are the breasts of the earth goddess,<br/>
the wide oceans are her clothes<br/>
the bright sun is her thilagam,<br/>
wide rivers are the ornaments on her ample chest,<br/>
large dark clouds are her hair,<br/>
and the ocean is her boundary.<br/>
She is three things, dharma, wealth and moksha.” <br/>
<br/>
2. Many get dharma and wealth<br/>
but they are not permanent.<br/>
People say there is a third thing <br/>
that is higher than those two,<br/>
but they speak in ignorance—I will explain why. <br/>
<br/>
3. The sun god rides on a chariot <br/>
yoked to seven horses and goes around the world– <br/>
does he only go to the world of the gods and stay there?<br/>
That would be like someone wanting to eat meat<br/>
who leaves a rabbit and goes after a crow. <br/>
<br/>
4. She says, <br/>
“O friend with beautiful young breasts,<br/>
listen to what happened to me.<br/>
I adorned my dark hair and tied it up,<br/>
put a band around my beautiful breasts<br/>
a mekalai around my waist,<br/>
and put kohl on my sharp spear-like eyes.<br/>
I was playing ball happily. <br/>
<br/>
5. “Thirumāl with eyes like beautiful lotuses <br/>
blooming in the water came there<br/>
carrying a lovely pot <br/>
and danced on the rich streets as drums played. <br/>
People saw him and felt happy. <br/>
<br/>
6. “My friends, my brothers and others came to me and told me, <br/>
‘Come, let us go and see him,’<br/>
and I went with them. It was my fate.<br/>
Suddenly my body grew pale <br/>
and the bangles on my hands became loose <br/>
and fell and I couldn’t find them. <br/>
Whatever others said to me, <br/>
I didn’t listen to them. <br/>
<br/>
7. “I was confused,<br/>
and became weak and pale. <br/>
My loving mother <br/>
with a voice as sweet as a parrot’s,<br/>
seeing me suffering, was concerned<br/>
and put vibhuti on my forehead to protect me. <br/>
<br/>
8. “She worshipped the god and asked for a boon,<br/>
saying, ‘I will give you a lovely fragrant garland <br/>
strung with Kuṛinji flowers.<br/>
Please take away my daughter’s sorrow.’<br/>
<br/>
9. “But whatever my mother did, <br/>
it didn’t remove the sorrow from my mind <br/>
or the pain of my love.<br/>
Some older mothers who saw how I suffered <br/>
how my body grew pale advised her, <br/>
‘Take her to a fortune teller <br/>
who can tell you how to remove her sickness. <br/>
She may tell you the truth.’ <br/>
<br/>
10, 11, 12. “When my mother summoned her,<br/>
the fortune teller with dark, tied-up hair<br/>
worshipped the god and was possessed.<br/>
She threw the paddy that my mother gave her <br/>
on a winnowing fan, sweated and trembled and said,<br/>
‘The thousand-named god has caused her sickness.<br/>
He has a dark cloud-colored body,<br/>
carries a valampuri conch in his hand<br/>
and is adorned with fragrant thulasi garlands.<br/>
O you with sharp spear-like eyes, do not worry. <br/>
I know who gave this sickness to your daughter<br/>
and I will tell you who he is. <br/>
He measured this earth with his feet,<br/>
shattered Lanka into pieces,<br/>
and protected the cows and the cowherds <br/>
from the storm with Govardhana mountain. <br/>
<br/>
13, 14, 15. “‘He churned the milky ocean to get nectar for the gods,<br/>
he grazed the cows,<br/>
and he swallowed all the worlds, kept them in his stomach<br/>
and spat them out. But that was not enough for him.<br/>
One day in cowherd village<br/>
lovely-waisted Yashoda, with beautiful feet,<br/>
amred coral mouth and round breasts tied with a band <br/>
spent a long time churning good yogurt with a churning stick. <br/>
Sweating as her beautiful waist hurt,<br/>
she took the butter and carefully put it in a pot<br/>
on the uṛi hanging on a rope. <br/>
He pretended as if he were sleeping<br/>
until Yashoda with a shining forehead had left. <br/>
Then he raised up his long arms as high as possible<br/>
took gobs of butter and swallowed it. <br/>
<br/>
14. “‘He rolled the pots on the floor<br/>
and again pretended to be sleeping.<br/>
When Yashoda came back she saw him <br/>
acting as if he didn’t know anything, <br/>
and she saw the pots rolling on the ground<br/>
but could not see any of the butter. <br/>
<br/>
15. “‘She hit herself on her stomach and said, <br/>
“Who could have done this except this naughty one?”<br/>
She asked Kaṇṇan, “Did you do this?”<br/>
She got very angry, shouted at him,<br/>
took a long rope, tied him to the mortar <br/>
and spanked him as the villagers looked on. <br/>
He didn’t stop her.<br/>
<br/>
16. “‘Do you know who he is?<br/>
He is the lord who jumped into the deep pond, <br/>
stirred up its abundant water and fought<br/>
the cruel thousand-headed snake Kaalingan.<br/>
<br/>
17. “‘With his sharp sword he cut off<br/>
the nose and ears of Raksasi Surpanaha<br/>
who told Rama that she was as beautiful as Sita.<br/>
He fought with Karan, the brother of Surpanaha <br/>
with his bow and made him suffer as if he were in hell.<br/>
<br/>
18, 19, 20. “‘When handsome broad-armed Rāvaṇa <br/>
took Sita whose lovely breasts were tied with a band to Lanka,<br/>
Rama went there, fought with Rāvaṇa, <br/>
drew his bow and cut off his ten heads.<br/>
As a man-lion he split open with his sharp claws <br/>
the chest of of Hiranyan, the long-speared fighter,<br/>
and wore his intestines on his chest as a garland,<br/>
striking his red kumkumam-smeared arms with his hands,<br/>
standing and shouting,<br/>
while Hiraṇyan lay in a flood of red blood.<br/>
<br/>
21. “‘When he took the form of a dwarf<br/>
and went to the king Mahābali, <br/>
asking for three feet of land,<br/>
that king assented, pouring water on the dwarf’s hands.<br/>
Then, tricking him, the god took a tall form <br/>
and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.<br/>
<br/>
22. “‘He churned the milky ocean with the gods <br/>
and the Asuras using Mandara mountain for a churning stick <br/>
and the snake Vasuki for a rope.<br/>
<br/>
23. “‘The elephant Gajendra, large as a dark mountain, <br/>
who would go to a pond every day to get a lotus flower <br/>
to worship the god,<br/>
was caught by a crocodile one day.<br/>
He raised his long trunk screamed out calling the god,<br/>
“Nārāyaṇā, you with the color of a diamond who rest on Adisesha,<br/>
come, remove my terrible distress.”<br/>
<br/>
24. “‘Our lord came to Gajendra <br/>
and, enraged at the crocodile, <br/>
cut it in two pieces with his discus and saved Gajendra.<br/>
It is the thousand-named lord <br/>
who has given this love sickness to your daughter, <br/>
making her crazy about him.’ <br/>
<br/>
25. The fortune teller told all these things to her mother <br/>
and she was pleased because her daughter had not been hurt. <br/>
She understood that she had fallen in love with the lord <br/>
adorned with a fresh thulasi garland <br/>
and realized that her daughter was crying<br/>
with tears falling from her beautiful spear-like eyes <br/>
because she had become his slave<br/>
and was not in love with anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
26, 28. The daughter says, <br/>
“I prattle on because I saw his dark cloud-like body.<br/>
I wander not knowing what to do<br/>
when the cool wind blows giving me pain.<br/>
The curly-haired women are gossiping about me,<br/>
but I can’t stop them and keep quiet. <br/>
<br/>
29. “I told my heart, <br/>
‘O heart, go to the sapphire-colored god<br/>
and ask him if he will give me his thulasi garland. <br/>
Speak to him when my enemies are not there—<br/>
otherwise they will give me trouble.<br/>
If he doesn’t answer you, just come back.”<br/>
But when I said that, my heart that went to him <br/>
who has the dark color of the ocean <br/>
did not come back and forgot me.<br/>
<br/>
30.- 33. “I have done bad karma. The villagers are making fun of me<br/>
and there is no one to help me.<br/>
My life melts like a candle near a fire. <br/>
My long eyes don’t sleep even if the whole village sleeps<br/>
and I prattle on saying the thousand names of the good lord. <br/>
When people fall in love it is like plunging into a dark ocean—<br/>
they don’t know the trouble it will bring. Let that be.”<br/>
<br/>
The daughter says, <br/>
34. “Let me tell you about a woman whose love is known to eveyone.<br/>
 Her name is Vāsavadathathai.<br/>
Once she left all her friends and went along the wide street<br/>
behind her broad-armed garlanded beloved. <br/>
The villagers gossiped saying mean things about her. <br/>
Here is what I am going to do.<br/>
<br/>
35  - 40. “I have decided to go to temples to see the dark one. <br/>
I will go to beautiful Thiruvenkaṭam, Thirukkovalur, <br/>
strong-walled Kachi, Thiruvuragam, Thirupperagam,<br/>
Veḷḷaṛai, temple of the god<br/>
who walked through the large marudam trees <br/>
and destroyed the Asurans,<br/>
Thiruvekka, Thiruvaali, Thiruthangaal,<br/>
Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with water, Thiruppuliyur, <br/>
Srirangam surrounded with groves, <br/>
Thirukkaṇṇamangai, beautiful jewel-like Thirukkaṇṇanur,<br/>
Thiruviṇṇagaram, famous Thirukkaṇṇapuram,<br/>
Thirucheṛai, Thiruvazhundur, <br/>
Thirukkuḍandai, Thirukkaḍigai, Thirukkaḍalmallai,<br/>
Thiruviḍavendai, Thiruneermalai, <br/>
the famous Thirumālirunjolai, Thirumohur, <br/>
Thiruvadari praised by all, <br/>
northern Madurai and all other places of the god<br/>
without missing any.<br/>
I prattle on saying the thousand names<br/>
of the famous, lotus-eyed god<br/>
adorned with thulasi garlands dripping with honey<br/>
who broke the tusk of the elephant<br/>
and saved Gajendra from the crocodile, <br/>
Even if the villagers say nasty things about me<br/>
I will surely ride on a horse made of palm leaves.<br/>

22.  Periyathirumaḍal - Thirumangai (2713 -2790)</h3></center>
(78 Pāsurams) <br/>
<br/>
<strong> God in his yogic sleep on the ocean. </strong> <br/>
<br/>
As his bright emerald earrings throw out light,<br/>
the lord is like a large mountain<br/>
resting on the dotted snake Adisesha<br/>
with shining jewels on his thousand divine heads<br/>
The crowded stars in the sky <br/>
shine and cover him like an umbrella.(1)<br/>
<br/>
The sun and moon are his lights<br/>
and the waves of the ocean fan him. (2)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> The Earth goddess</strong> <br/>
<br/>
At Mahābali’s sacrifice with his divine lotus feet<br/>
he measured the earth goddess <br/>
whose hair is the clouds. <br/>
and the stars are the flower garlands that decorate it.(3)<br/>
<br/>
The tall hills of the Pandya king<br/>
and the divine northern Himalayas are her breasts,<br/>
and she walks like a swan. (4)<br/>
As the lord sleeps in deep yoga her beautiful hands caress his feet.<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Sages in Moksha </strong> <br/>
<br/>
The god created a shining lotus on his navel<br/>
and the four-headed Brahma on it. (5)<br/>
Brahma created the four Vedas <br/>
that show the path to dharma, poruḷ and happiness on the earth and moksha. (6)<br/>
Moksha can only be attained after the body has gone to the other world.<br/>
Those who want to reach it<br/>
should eat fallen fruits, dried leaves, make their bodies thin,<br/>
sleep in a hut roofed with leaves (7)<br/>
and do tapas standing in the heat of the sun<br/>
and plunging into the water in ponds.<br/>
One can only say that these are the people who could reach moksha.<br/>
This is what one knows. <br/>
No one can tell others could reach moksha <br/>
by any other way unless they see them there. (8)<br/>
<br/>
 If you know any people who have reached moksha,<br/>
crossing the world of heat (9) tell us who they are. <br/>
Without knowing their names<br/>
just to say that we know that they reached moksha <br/>
shows that they are ignorant. <br/>
We will talk about them later.   (9-10) <br/>
<br/>
<strong> The sages enter Indra’s world and enjoy it. (11 - 22) </strong> <br/>
<br/>
Let us look at the life of sages. <br/>
As the gods praise them,<br/>
they enter the golden world of Indra, <br/>
the thousand-eyed king of the gods.<br/>
They sit on shining thrones (11 and 12)<br/>
where young women with long sword-like eyes fan them<br/>
and a fresh breeze blows on them. (13)<br/>
There gentle doe-eyed women with waists as thin as lightning <br/>
smile with their white teeth that shine<br/>
like the rising crescent moon.<br/>
The sages see the karpaga forest glittering like gold<br/>
where bees in the groves sing sweetly<br/>
and the honey from the blossoms <br/>
of the Mandaram trees that grow everywhere<br/>
and they play in that world with the dark-eyed Apsaras <br/>
with waists thin as lightning and beautiful as peacocks . (14)<br/>
They stay in the golden diamond-studded mandapam<br/>
whose marble shines and with coral pillars<br/>
and there they listen contentedly to the sweet music<br/>
that the Aparasas play on their yāzhs. (15)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Indra’s Palace (16 -22)</strong> <br/>
<br/>
The sages stay in palaces that shine like lightning <br/>
as the clouds float above them. <br/>
The moon shines from the sky<br/>
and many bright lamps hang in the rooms where they stay(16).<br/>
Women with lovely cool eyes,<br/>
wearing flowers that drip honey in their hair, <br/>
spread beds and open the doors for them. ((17)<br/>
There men wear fragrant mandaram flower garlands on their arms<br/>
and bees from the karpaga flowers swarm around them. <br/>
Swans wander in the garden.<br/>
The sweet fresh breeze enters their room<br/>
and dries the fragrant sandal paste that the Apsarasas <br/>
have smeared on their young breasts. (18)<br/>
The men joyfully put their hands on the lightning-like waists<br/>
and the ornaments on the women’s breasts make noise.(19)<br/>
The sound of their jewels give joy to the hearts of the men.<br/>
They drink the nectar from the mouths of the women <br/>
with large eyes that never blink, <br/>
enjoying their doe-like look and lovely smiles. (20)<br/>
<br/>
Such is the result of their penance,<br/>
which at best achieves only passion.<br/>
I have described (21)<br/>
Doe-eyed women who walk like swans <br/>
will not ride on maḍal when they love men<br/>
even if others gossip about them.<br/>
I have heard this and know it from the southern tradition,<br/>
but I don’t want to worry about that.<br/>
I haveonly described what the northern tradition says. (22)<br/>
<br/>
23 - 28. Those who do not want to follow the northern tradition<br/>
will not know the coolness of the sandal paste<br/>
from the Podiyam hills of Pandyan kings. (23)<br/>
They will not understand the beauty of the sweet music <br/>
of the flutes of the cowherds,<br/>
or the suffering of women when hear the bells of the cows<br/>
returning home in the evening. (24)<br/>
When they hear the sorrowful sound<br/>
of the calling of the andril birds on the palm tree <br/>
separated from their mates, they will not feel pain. (25)<br/>
When the shining moon in the sky sends its cool rays,<br/>
their bodies will not burn. (26)<br/>
<br/>
When Kama shoots his flower arrows from his everlasting bow<br/>
they will not die and go to the golden street in heaven. (27)<br/>
They will stay on their flower beds<br/>
with women whose hair is decorated with flowers<br/>
as a breeze caresses their waists and soft breasts,<br/>
and they will sleep with those women who are precious like gold.<br/>
Let them enjoy themselves. (28)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Women who suffered to find and follow their beloveds. </strong> <br/>
<br/>
Vaidehi. <br/>
Rama going to the forest with Vaidehi. <br/>
<br/>
Rama obeyed his father, the heroic king Dasaratha, <br/>
gave up the rich kingdom <br/>
making all the people of the kingdom suffer<br/>
and left his country. (29)<br/>
He went fast as lightning in a bright chariot,<br/>
wandered in a hot forest<br/>
where murderous hungry peys wandered.<br/>
The paths there were filled with stones<br/>
and bamboo plants were broken and burned, <br/>
and the wind blew wildly (30)<br/>
Vaidehi, his beautiful wife, went with him,<br/>
walking like a swan on her soft cotton-like feet <br/>
on stone paths where the cruel sun’s strong heat<br/>
burned the earth. (31)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Vegavathi searching for her beloved.</strong> <br/>
<br/>
When Vegavathi, a young girl <br/>
with a waist as thin as lightning<br/>
lost her husband as dear as her life,<br/>
she went with her elder brother to find him.<br/>
They searched and finally found him<br/>
who was strong as a bull, with mighty arms like stone <br/>
and she embraced his golden chest. (32)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> The daughter of Nagarajan of the snake world finding Arjuna.</strong> <br/>
<br/>
Arjuna the matchless hero, <br/>
whose shining long spear killed his enemies,<br/>
was the son of Guru, the king of the famous country<br/>
where the Ganges flows with abundant water.<br/>
The beautiful daughter of the king of snakes <br/>
without shyness, fear or modesty<br/>
embraced him, crushing her breasts<br/>
on his mountain-like golden chest<br/>
and took him to the snake world<br/>
where she loved him and they lived happily. <br/>
Haven’t we heard that story? (33 -36)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Usha, Vāṇan’s daughter and Māyavan.</strong> <br/>
<br/>
Vāṇan, the king of the Asurans with a shining sword <br/>
ruled a golden country that was like Indra’s world <br/>
and conquered the whole earth surrounded by the oceans. <br/>
His daughter was more beautiful than any other woman. (37)<br/>
Her dear friend obtained the thulasi garland<br/>
of the lord Māyavan with lovely mountain-like arms and gave it to Usha.<br/>
Then she brought the god Māyavan to her <br/>
so that he could be happy with her.<br/>
O friends, haven’ṭ you heard this story? (37 -39)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Parvathi doing tapas to marry Shiva. </strong> <br/>
<br/>
O, beautiful girls, what more can I say?<br/>
Uma, the precious daughter of the king of Himalayas,<br/>
was as divine as a goddess, with teeth like shining jewels and a red mouth,<br/>
a soft waist and the walk of a swan.<br/>
As she did tapas to see Shiva, wearing her hair as matted locks her golden body <br/>withered and she controlled all her senses.<br/>
<br/>
Shiva came to the forest where she was doing tapas, <br/>
extending his thousand arms and hands<br/>
in all the eight directions and shining like fire.<br/>
His feet adorned with heroic anklets <br/>
crossed all the seven precious worlds and went to the sky. <br/>
The gods in the sky worshiped the lord<br/>
and the everlasting mountains, the wind and the stars <br/>
whirled around the dancer Shiva adorned with vibhuthi.<br/>
She praised the trident of the dancing lord <br/>
that destroys Asurans and embraced him. <br/>
<br/>
She says, <br/>
“Don’t you know that I have done bad karma<br/>
and have not received the grace of the god like they have?<br/>
If I begin to tell all the stories of wonderful women<br/>
it will be endless like the Bharatham. (40 -42)<br/>
<br/>
"I will tell how I suffer from love—listen.<br/>
I entered the golden door<br/>
of the palace studded with diamonds, <br/>
as large as the mountain in Thirunaṛaiyur<br/>
surrounded with thick groves <br/>
where good Vediyars recite the Vedas (43)<br/>
and I saw the lord there and my eyes rejoiced. <br/>
His divine chest, mouth, feet, beautiful hands <br/>
and eyes shone like flowers blooming in a forest on a golden mountain.<br/>
His chest is adorned with a long thread <br/>
and he wears arm bracelets, shining earrings, chains, a tall crown<br/>
and a Sulamaṇi ornament that shines like the bright sun<br/>
as he shines like an emerald hill. (45)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> She describes Lakshmi</strong> <br/>
<br/>
Lakshmi his wife, like a beautiful young vanji creeper<br/>
stays near him. <br/>
Her walk is like a swan’s, <br/>
her eyes are innocent like a doe’s, <br/>
she is lovely as a peacock<br/>
and shines like lightning.<br/>
Her arms are like young bamboo,<br/>
her breasts are like two pots,<br/>
her mouth is red like a thondai fruit<br/>
and her eyes are like two kendai fish. <br/>
Divine, she stood near him<br/>
but I did not see her as she stood there. <br/>
<br/>
She says,<br/>
“My heart and my mind grew weak,<br/>
the bracelets on my hands<br/>
and the golden mekalai on my waist grew loose.<br/>
The roaring of the ocean increases the pain of my love. (46)<br/>
and the cool moon sheds its hot rays on me.<br/>
How is it their nature has changed?<br/>
The sweet breeze carrying the fragrance of the blossoms<br/>
on the southern king Pandiyan’s mountain Pothiyam, <br/>
mingled with the smell of sandal wood and the pollen of flowers<br/>
blows making all the people of the world happy. <br/>
But to me that fresh breeze is as if burning air were streaming on me. <br/>
As the andril bird in a nest made of screw pine flower on a palm tree <br/>
calls her beloved male bird with her small voice<br/>
it is like a sword splitting open my chest.<br/>
What can I do? “<br/>
<br/>
She says,<br/>
“Kama has a sugarcane bow in his arms that are strong as stone.<br/>
He bends it, flexing his arms, and shoots flower arrows (47)<br/>
at me with my chest as his target.<br/>
There is no one to protect me from him.” (48)<br/>
<br/>
She says,<br/>
“I am innocent. <br/>
What is the use of my being a woman, my beauty and my breasts<br/>
if I cannot embrace the golden chest of the lord<br/>
who shines like a golden hill <br/>
and is the beloved of Lakshmi?<br/>
<br/>
If my breasts do not embrace the lord of Thirukaṇṇapuram<br/>
my breasts and my beauty will become like a blooming creeper <br/>
that withers spreading its fragrance in vain<br/>
in a stony forest in a dry land<br/>
<br/>
All these things are burden for me. <br/>
Is there anyone who knows a remedy to <br/>
stop this pain of love that keeps increasing?( 49, 50)<br/>
<br/>
The sound of the bells tied on the necks of the cows <br/>
in the evening is sweet for most people, (51)<br/>
but to my ears it is as cruel as the sound of a killing spear.<br/>
Tell me how I can save myself from this pain, tell me. (52)<br/>
The cloud-colored lord <br/>
whose chest is adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland<br/>
gave me this love sickness.” (53)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> The heroism of the Lord and how she riding on madal after <br/>
telling the power of Thirumāl. (54 - 78)</strong> <br/>
<br/>
She says, <br/>
“He released the beautiful crescent moon from his curse,<br/>
built a bridge on the ocean to go to Lanka,<br/>
shot his arrows and fought with king Rāvaṇa in a cruel battle <br/>
made his ten heads decorated with golden crowns fall to the ground<br/>
and sent him to the golden world in the sky.” (54). <br/>
<br/>
<strong> Hiraṇyan and the man-lion.</strong> <br/>
<br/>
She says, <br/>
“Hiraṇyan with his strong hands<br/>
fought with thousand-eyed Indra, king of the gods <br/>
and the gods and took over Indra’s world <br/>
and the golden world of the gods.	<br/>
Our god with a discus in his mighty hand<br/>
took the form of a lion (55)<br/>
went to Hiraṇyan with fiery eyes and fought with him,<br/>
pulling the Asuran by the hair, <br/>
sitting him on his thigh,<br/>
and splitting open his chest with his sharp claws.<br/>
<br/>
<strong> God in the form of a boar</strong> <br/>
<br/>
“When the earth goddess was hidden<br/>
in the bottom of the ocean by an Asuran, <br/>
our god, the dancer, took the form of a boar,<br/>
went into the ocean and brought up the earth goddess<br/>
on his sharp murderous tusks. (56)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> Thirumāl churning the milky ocean with gods and Asurans. </strong> <br/>
<br/>
“Using Mandara mountain as a churning stick <br/>
and the snake Vasuki as the rope, <br/>
he churned the milky ocean<br/>
and the bright sun, moon and all shining things <br/>
in the sky swirled around as he churned. <br/>
The generous god took the sweet nectar from the ocean,<br/>
gave it to the gods in the sky<br/>
and removed their affliction. (57)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> God in the form of a dwarf</strong> <br/>
<br/>
“Taking the form of a dwarf whom no one could recognize<br/>
he went as a bachelor to the golden sacrifice of king Mahābali. (58)<br/>
He cheated the heroic king, melted his heart by pretending to be a sage.<br/>
He asked the king, <br/>
‘O king, I want three feet of land <br/>
and I will measure the distance with my feet.’<br/>
Before the dwarf could finish speaking, <br/>
the king said, ‘I have already given that.’<br/>
At those words, (59)<br/>
the god grew tall and his crown, shining like lightning,<br/>
touched the sky and his ankleted feet crossed over all the seven worlds.(60)<br/>
All the gods and the Asurans saw him and trembled<br/>
as his feet went upwards and took over the wide world and the sky. <br/>
He cheated Mahābali with his feet and made all the world his own.” (61)<br/>
<br/>
<strong> She praises the Divyadesams where the god stays and worships him<br/>
</strong> <br/>
“He, the beloved of the goddess with a lighting-like waist,<br/>
fights in the war like a bull.<br/>
He stays on the golden mountain of Thiruviṇṇagar<br/>
and he is the god of the flourishing Kudandai<br/>
where the Ponni river brings jewel and leaves them on its banks.<br/>
Majestic as a red coral hill, <br/>
he is the god of Thirukkkuṛunguḍi in the Pandiyan country.<br/>
He is the generous god of Thiruthaṇcheṛai. (62)<br/>
my sweet nectar and the god of Thiruvayalāli <br/>
surrounded with beautiful water where swans sleep.<br/>
Strong as a mountain, he is the god of Thiruyevvuḷ,<br/>
and generous as the kaṛpagam tree,<br/>
and the god of Thirukkaṇṇamangai surrounded with strong forts. <br/>
He is lightning, the bright sun and moon<br/>
and the god of Thiruveḷḷaṛai. <br/>
As precious as gold, he is the god of Thirukkallaṛai.<br/>
Gold and emerald, a fighting bull, he is the god of Thirupuṭkuzhi.<br/>
He, the god of everlasting Srirangam<br/>
shines like a precious diamond. (63)<br/>
<br/>
He, the beloved of Lakshmi, stays in Thiruvallavāzh.<br/>
Never born, he is the god of Thirupperur. <br/>
He lies on Adisesha on the ancient ocean,<br/>
He is a faultless shining jewel and he stays in my mind always. <br/>
He is the lord of Thiruviḍaventhai,<br/>
the Māyavan, the god of Thirukkaḍalmallai, (64)<br/>
worshipped by the gods in the sky<br/>
<br/>
He is the strong god of Thiruthangāl,<br/>
the essence known by no one, a pearl.<br/>
He took the form of a swan, fish, man-lion <br/>
and he is the divine Vedas whose meaning no one knows.<br/>
He swallowed all the worlds in ancient times. (65) <br/>
He is the god of everlasting Thiruviḍaikkazhi<br/>
who drank the milk from Putana as she screamed, (66)<br/>
the shining god of Thiruvazhundur <br/>
where swans look for food in the wet mud.<br/>
He, my dear lord, stays in south Thillaichithrakuḍam, (67)<br/>
the clever god of Thiruvenkaṭam where clouds move with lightning. <br/>
He, a king and the beloved of Lakshmi, stays in Thirumālirunjolai<br/>
carrying a discus that kills his enemies. (68)<br/>
He has the form of a man-lion in Thirukkoṭṭiyur,<br/>
a flood of sweet nectar and the god of Thirumeyyam,<br/>
the good Andaṇan of Thiruvindaḷur,<br/>
the man-lion of Thiruveḷukkai in Thirukkachi<br/>
surrounded with strong forts.<br/>
He is the young god of Thiruppāḍagam, (69)<br/>
the god of Thiruvekkaa sunk in deep yoga.<br/>
He is the god of Thiruvuragam,<br/>
the strong bull of Thiruvaṭṭapuyagaram<br/>
and the Esan who stays in my heart. (70)<br/>
<br/>
He, the god of the gods,<br/>
is the light of Thirumuzhikkaḷam<br/>
and the god of Thiruvādanur giving food to all.<br/>
He is past, present and future, (71)<br/>
the god of Thiruneermalai and the four everlasting Vedas. <br/>
<br/>
He is Tamizh flourishing in Thiruppullāṇi in the Pandiyan country and he is Sanskrit.<br/>
He is the beloved of Lakshmi and shines like the moon,<br/>
the god of Maṇimādakkoyil in Naagai,<br/>
and the god of Thiruchengāḍu surrounded by the ocean. (72)<br/>
I worship the god Kaṇṇan,<br/>
the lord of Thirukkaṇṇapuram<br/>
and of Maṇimāḍakkoyil in southern Thirunaṛaiyur.”<br/>
<br/>
She says, <br/>
“He is as strong as a bull with arms like mountains. <br/>
I will go and see him, folding my hands and worshiping him. <br/>
I will tell him how I feel,<br/>
if my dear lord does not give his grace<br/>
holding me close to his chest, (73)<br/>
<br/>
I will go to the villages where girls with lightning-thin waists, <br/>
Vediyars and sages live<br/>
and tell the kings with spears that kill enemies in battles<br/>
and all the crowds of people<br/>
and the people who live in all countries<br/>
about all the things he has done to me.” (74) .<br/>
<br/>
She says, <br/>
“When he went to the cowherd village, <br/>
stole butter and yogurt churned and kept<br/>
by beautiful fish-eyed cowherd women, <br/>
and ate them and filled his stomach full,<br/>
the women caught him and tied him to a mortar.<br/>
When he took the form of a bhudam<br/>
and ate all the food that the cowherds had kept for Indra, (75)<br/>
Indra grew angry, brought a storm, <br/>
and the lord carried Govardhana mountain<br/>
as an umbrella and protected the cowherds <br/>
and the cows from the storm.<br/>
<br/>
When Kaṇṇan went to Duriyodhana’s assembly <br/>
for the Pandavas as a messenger, <br/>
he was disgraced by the Kauravas.<br/>
He danced on a pot as drums were beaten <br/>
and beautiful women saw looked on in enjoyment,<br/>
exclaiming, ‘How could he dance so wonderfully?’<br/>
<br/>
When Surpankaha, the princess of Lanka, Ravana's sister,<br/>
fell in love with Rama, took the form of a beautiful woman <br/>
and came to the forest and told Rama that she loved him, (76)<br/>
Rama was angry and cut off her nose. <br/>
He also killed the mighty Thāḍagai (77)<br/>
when she came to fight with him.<br/>
<br/>
MADAL<br/>
<br/>
I will think of all these deeds<br/>
and ride on horse made of palm leaves, the maḍal, <br/>
of a flourishing palm tree.” (78)<br/>
