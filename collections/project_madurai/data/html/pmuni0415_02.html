<br/>

1. O beloved goddess,  <br/>
you are a fertile green creeper,<br/>
blooming in all the seven worlds.<br/>
You are the beloved of god Shiva <br/>
who has an eye on his forehead and <br/>
a dark cloud-like neck.<br/>
O mother, you are a precious thing <br/>
in the flourishing kadamba forest.<br/>
Your devotees who receive your grace<br/>
will not have any trouble. <br/>
<br/>
2. O beloved goddess,<br/>
you share half of Chokkanaadar’s body <br/>
and embrace his eight arms,<br/>
and your mountain like breasts <br/>
quarrel with him.<br/>
<br/>
You left him for a while  <br/>
because you wish to show him <br/>
the benefit of love quarrel.<br/>
O goddess, <br/>
you need the grace of god Shiva, <br/>
your husband.<br/>
Your divine plays<br/>
fill my auspicious heart <br/>
with joy of devotion.<br/>
<br/>
3. You and three-eyed Shiva  <br/>
gave birth to the young elephant god <br/>
who pours out rut,<br/>
<br/>
You stay in the kadamba forest <br/>
stealing the heart <br/>
of  Shiva with love.<br/>
<br/>
Our father Shiva composed <br/>
a poem for his devotee  <br/>
Panapathran, so that he could get<br/>
gold from the king.<br/>
<br/>
O goddess, <br/>
you took half of his body <br/>
and stay there.<br/>
Is it not cruel to do this?<br/>
They say that you have good qualities and <br/>
how it is possible for you to do this?<br/>
<br/>
4. O goddess!<br/>
god Shiva seeing your kind nature,<br/>
requested you to marry him, <br/>
you accepted it  <br/>
and embraced his chest lovingly. <br/>
<br/>
Even though you knew that <br/>
your sweet lord  Shiva <br/>
has a snake on his body, <br/>
you did not refuse to marry him,<br/>
and shared the left side of his body.<br/>
O goddess, <br/>
you have lovely breasts <br/>
and you are worshipped by women <br/>
decorated with precious bracelets. <br/>
<br/>
5. O sweet honey, <br/>
what is the use of you<br/>
giving your young Pandyan country <br/>
to Shiva who has a dark neck ?<br/>
Even after receiving the Pandyan country<br/>
he doesn’t stop begging every day.<br/>
<br/>
He composed a poem <br/>
and gave that to <br/>
a poor brahmin Dharmi, <br/>
so that he could get gold from the king.<br/>
<br/>
If Shiva has heavy breasts like you <br/>
would he be able to dance <br/>
changing his right leg to left <br/>
in Madurai?<br/>
<br/>
6. O goddess Karpuravalli, <br/>
your fragrant hair is decorated with flowers.<br/>
You rule in the kadamba<br/>
forest of Madurai<br/>
where excellent Tamil flourishes,<br/>
protecting all the worlds.<br/>
<br/>
God Shiva, the ocean of joy<br/>
who dances in the silver hall<br/>
seeing your dark fish-like lovely eyes<br/>
wishes to play with you. <br/>
You see the divine river <br/>
Ganges flows on his jata,<br/>
and you quarrel with him, <br/>
because you are jealous of the Ganges.<br/>
<br/>
7. O goddess, precious Karpuravalli,<br/>
you are a beautiful creeper <br/>
in the kadamba forest.<br/>
You, the Abhisheka valli, <br/>
are eternally young.  <br/>
<br/>
You make the great god Shiva <br/>
to act as you wish.<br/>
There are no other divine acts, <br/>
for you, except making us, <br/>
your devotees to sing <br/>
and listen to your praise.<br/>
<br/>
8. You are as lovely as a lotus blossom.<br/>
You, the divine one, are as fragrant as camphor.<br/>
As Shiva, the god of Madurai bows to you <br/>
touching your lotus feet with his head, <br/>
the umathai flowers on his head <br/>
makes your feet fragrant. <br/>
Even though that famous lord Shiva, <br/>
burnt the three forts of his enemies <br/>
using the Meru mountain as his golden bow.<br/>
to protect the gods, he bows to you.<br/>
What is the use of such valor?<br/>
Isn’t he crazy that he bows to you<br/>
and his head touches your feet?<br/>
<br/>
9. O goddess of the kadamba forest!<br/>
my heart is a small house for you and <br/>
you have not yet come to live in it <br/>
with your husband, the joy of yours.<br/>
Wouldn't it be a suitable abode for you?<br/>
My heart is filled with darkness. <br/>
O lustrous one, <br/>
you rise and come, <br/>
light up my heart and stay there.<br/>
<br/>
10.  The roaring Vaikai river<br/>
flows from the Southern hills,  <br/>
where golden shining lotuses bloom<br/>
and our cool excellent Tamil  <br/>
flourishes in those hills <br/>
where gentle breezes blow.<br/>
<br/>
The golden temple of Thiruvaalavaay<br/>
flourishing with karpaga flowers<br/>
and my melting soft heart<br/>
are the temples for goddess Karpuravalli,<br/>
who steals the strong heart of Chokkar.<br/>
<br/>
11.  O my heart, <br/>
you are a divine temple <br/>
for the goddess Abhishekavalli.<br/>
whose hair is as dark as cloud.<br/>
O Yama, if you come to me <br/>
against the will of my goddess, <br/>
I say it is not <br/>
the right thing for you to do.<br/>
<br/>
12. O goddess, <br/>
you are the sweet nectar, <br/>
and the dear daughter of the southern king,<br/>
and you stay in the golden temple of Alavaay<br/>
protected in all directions <br/>
by eight heroic elephants, <br/>
with hanging trunks.<br/>
<br/>
You are the remedy for all our troubles.<br/>
I am born in this world to suffer.<br/>
I want to reach <br/>
the lotus feet of the unique <br/>
god Shiva of Alavaay. <br/>
Help me.<br/>
<br/>
13. You, the beautiful golden creeper,<br/>
gave the southern mountain and<br/>
your lovely Pandyan land to Shiva, <br/>
precious like a golden hill and <br/>
the king of the Himalayas,<br/>
the silver mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The mark of your breasts <br/>
are  pressed on Shiva's chest,<br/>
when you embraced him tightly. <br/>
Isn’t the fragrance of your breast <br/>
the cause of his fragrance?<br/>
<br/>
14. "You are as precious as a diamond and an emerald,<br/>
and you are the remedy for our troubles. "<br/>
I will not worship you and <br/>
praise you with these words as those devotees.<br/>
I will not approach those devotees<br/>
who praise you with such words.<br/>
I will not go away from here to them.<br/>
<br/>
O lovely jewel of beautiful Madurai.<br/>
I will tell you my wish. <br/>
I know you are <br/>
the mother of all creatures, <br/>
and I will not go anywhere <br/>
from here leaving you .<br/>
<br/>
15. O goddess Karpuravalli, <br/>
your hair is tied up beautifully   <br/>
as a bun on your head. <br/>
You smile sweetly and <br/>
your long spear-like eyes <br/>
dart like kendai fish.<br/>
You have a red mouth <br/>
as lovely as murungai blossoms. <br/>
<br/>
When you entered my heart,<br/>
at the same time the goddess of art Saraswathi  <br/>
entered my tongue <br/>
so that I could praise you <br/>
with my poems.<br/>
<br/>
16. O goddess, <br/>
you share half of god Shiva's body.<br/>
I have a tongue just to praise you, <br/>
and a mind to meditate upon you only.<br/>
I have learnt excellent Tamil poems <br/>
to praise you. <br/>
<br/>
The kadamba forest where you stay <br/>
blooms with lovely flowers that drip honey.<br/>
O goddess, I do not have string to tie <br/>
a garland and decorate you.<br/>
<br/>
17. The goddess as beautiful as a puvai bird <br/>
wears the flowers of kadamba forest.<br/>
She accepts the poetry that I compose.<br/>
My mouth and heart praise <br/>
her golden feet every day.<br/>
My words are fragrance <br/>
for her feet as soft as flowers.<br/>
<br/>
18. O divine one, <br/>
please adorn my poems <br/>
thinking that they are beautiful.<br/>
Are you ashamed to accept them <br/>
because Tamil words have faults<br/>
like the poet Nakkirar said?<br/>
O goddess, <br/>
you stay in the divine Kudal city <br/>
with god Shiva who burnt <br/>
the three forts just smiling at them.<br/>
Do you both have faults<br/>
just like the faults of the words <br/>
and their meanings in Tamil <br/>
as the poet Nakkirar told you? <br/>
<br/>
19. O goddess,<br/>
Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, <br/>
who stays on a blooming golden lotus, <br/>
serves you. <br/>
You stay in the kadamba forest<br/>
blooming with flowers, in southern Madurai<br/>
and your devotees wait to praise you.<br/>
<br/>
20. O goddess of Kudal city,<br/>
are you  Goddess Lakshmi, precious like gold, <br/>
who stays on a lotus?<br/>
Does the goddess Saraswathi  belongs <br/>
to your parental home? <br/>
<br/>
O goddess, Karpuravalli!<br/>
you leaving your birth place, the Kudal city,<br/>
and your in laws’ place, the Kailasa mountain,<br/>
entered my worthless lotus heart with God Shiva.<br/>
What is the reason for the goddess to do this?<br/>

<br/>
Praise of Siddhi Vinayakar <br/>
<br/>
Let me praise the feet of Siddhi Vinayaka, our help,  <br/>
who has a long dotted face, <br/>
two wide ears dripping with rut,<br/>
one tusk, a long trunk and an opened mouth, <br/>
heroic cheeks and small eyes. <br/>
<br/>
Let god Ganesa bless me<br/>
so that I could compose <br/>
kuram poems in sweet Tamil <br/>
praising the fish-eyed divine goddess, Karpuravalli  <br/>
whose hair is decorated with flowers.  <br/>
She is the queen of Madurai <br/>
surrounded with groves <br/>
where the clouds float.<br/>
<br/>
1. O ammee,<br/>
I am the gypsy come <br/>
from the southern Potiya hills,<br/>
where the sweet moon <br/>
shines on its peaks that <br/>
belong to the fish-eyed goddess<br/>
who stays in Madurai <br/>
where the fertile groves<br/>
bloom with flowers.<br/>
<br/>
2.  O amme! <br/>
I am the gypsy come <br/>
from the southern Potiya hills <br/>
where the pure white waterfalls<br/>
drop and bring gold and pearls,<br/>
from the hills of the fish- eyed goddess<br/>
who stays in the beautiful Madurai <br/>
flourishing with fertile sugar cane fields<br/>
and luscious paddy fields.<br/>
<br/>
3. O amme, <br/>
the Chola king Karikaalan <br/>
and the southern Pandyan kings <br/>
planted their tiger emblem and<br/>
the fish emblem on the Himalayas,<br/>
the northern mountain <br/>
and ruled that land.<br/>
<br/>
She is as beautiful as a doll <br/>
and she is the precious daughter <br/>
of southern Pandyan king.<br/>
She has coral-like lips, fish-like eyes,<br/>
and her words are as sweet as fruits.<br/>
Her hair is decorated <br/>
with fragrant lotus flowers,<br/>
swarming with bees.<br/>
<br/>
I am the gypsy come <br/>
from the Potiya hills<br/>
where the Tamil sage Agastya stays  <br/>
and worships in his mind <br/>
the feet of the goddess,<br/>
decorated with anklets.<br/>
<br/>
4. O amme,<br/>
the goddess is young forever.<br/>
Her breasts are decorated with kumkum.<br/>
Her hands are lovely like blooming lotuses.<br/>
Her eyes frolic like fish.<br/>
She composed the Vedas. <br/>
She shares half the body of Shiva, <br/>
the Chokkalingan <br/>
whose feet are adorned <br/>
with sounding anklets.<br/>
<br/>
O You are lovely as a kollippaavai!<br/>
you will join <br/>
god Shiva and be happy.<br/>
<br/>
5. O amme! <br/>
you are a lovely creeper.<br/>
You shine like gold.<br/>
You are as beautiful as a peacock.<br/>
Your voice is as sweet as a cuckoo <br/>
that sings beautifully.<br/>
O amme, Shiva, the ‘pazi anji chokkar’ <br/>
will come to you and love you.<br/>
<br/>
6. O amme! <br/>
smear the floor with fragrant paste.<br/>
Put a turmeric god Ganesa on it.<br/>
Decorate the floor with shinning kolam.<br/>
Put a pot full of grain in the middle of it.<br/>
<br/>
7. O amme! <br/>
give me your hands  <br/>
adorned with rings.<br/>
I will tell your fortune.<br/>
The god Shiva, who shares half of his body<br/>
with the lovely fish-eyed goddess <br/>
will give his grace to you.<br/>
He will come to you and love you.<br/>
<br/>
8. O amme!<br/>
who could make fun of me <br/>
saying that the kuri that I tell is false?<br/>
<br/>
O amme!<br/>
you have soft fragrant hair, <br/>
and surely the handsome Saundara maarar  <br/>
will come and embrace you.<br/>
<br/>
9. O, amme, <br/>
you are young.<br/>
Give me your lovely hand, <br/>
and I will tell the kuri, <br/>
that you wish to hear, come.<br/>
The gracious god Chokkalingan <br/>
who shares half of his body <br/>
with our fish- eyed goddess <br/>
will come and embrace you.<br/>
<br/>
10. O amme, <br/>
place clothes and money <br/>
in the place of worship.<br/>
Your love will be fulfilled.<br/>
I will tell you,<br/>
the god of Kailasa<br/>
the king of Madurai <br/>
will come and embrace you.<br/>
<br/>
11. O  amme, <br/>
you are as lovely as a blooming creeper<br/>
and your waist is small .<br/>
<br/>
The kuri on your hands <br/>
and face shows good luck.<br/>
<br/>
The lizard making noise <br/>
in the right corner.<br/>
is good luck for you.<br/>
<br/>
The seven virgin goddesses came <br/>
and  told me that the kuri that <br/>
I tell will become true.<br/>
<br/>
My left eye throbs <br/>
and that tells me that <br/>
my kuri will be true.<br/>
<br/>
Would all these signs tell me <br/>
that what I say will be false?<br/>
You will embrace the chest of Shiva  <br/>
that has the marks of the <br/>
bracelets and breasts <br/>
of the fish- eyed goddess, <br/>
pretty as a puvai bird.<br/>
<br/>
12. O amme, <br/>
the mighty eight hills-like elephants <br/>
in all eight directions protect <br/>
the earth goddess.<br/>
<br/>
The earth goddess’s two large mountains <br/>
are her two breasts. <br/>
The king of snakes <br/>
who has thousand heads, <br/>
and mouths, carries her on his head.<br/>
<br/>
My mountain is the southern Potiya hills,<br/>
where gentle breezes blow always, <br/>
lovelier than the northern mountain.<br/>
<br/>
13. O amme.<br/>
the moon shines with   <br/>
bright rays and crowns the<br/>
top of my mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The breezes love to play in our hills,<br/>
and the dark clouds float  <br/>
all over our hills.<br/>
<br/>
The Tamil sage Agastya lives<br/>
in our hills.<br/>
<br/>
Waterfalls spray and drop <br/>
bubbling with water in our hills,<br/>
just like the divine grace <br/>
that our fish-eyed goddess<br/>
pours on her devotees. <br/>
That is the Potiya mountain <br/>
where I come from.<br/>
<br/>
14. O amme! <br/>
murderous elephants <br/>
pour ruts from their ears, <br/>
wander and trumpet in our hills.<br/>
<br/>
A soft gentle breeze blows pleasantly <br/>
in our hills and<br/>
lovely southern Tamil flourishes <br/>
in our country.<br/>
<br/>
Our Potiya hills are beautiful <br/>
with high golden peaks<br/>
and its slopes are filled <br/>
with flourishing groves.<br/>
Happy swans play <br/>
in the deep pond on the slopes.<br/>
<br/>
The fish-eyed goddess, <br/>
who has curly hair, <br/>
like the sand of the seashore, <br/>
and as lovely as a female elephant, <br/>
rules our mountain.<br/>
I come from that Potiya hills.<br/>
<br/>
15. O amme,<br/>
fragrant breezes blow <br/>
pleasantly in our hills.<br/>
Northern and southern arts <br/>
flourish in our hills. <br/>
<br/>
The prince Karthikeya <br/>
plays on our hills.<br/>
Gold and nine types of <br/>
jewels grow on our hills.<br/>
<br/>
The fish-eyed goddess stays happily <br/>
in our Potiya hills, <br/>
protecting the world.<br/>
I come from that Potiya hills.<br/>
<br/>
16. O amme! <br/>
Lions and heroic elephants <br/>
play together on one side.<br/>
Angry tigers and tender deers  <br/>
stay happily together on one side.<br/>
Strong bears play with gentle deer <br/>
together on one side.<br/>
Snakes and lovely peacocks <br/>
feast together on one side.<br/>
O amme,<br/>
such is the unity and peace in our hills.<br/>
<br/>
The sage Agastya stays in our southern hills <br/>
and worships the beautiful lotus feet <br/>
of our goddess Abhisehakavalli. <br/>
She rules this beautiful world,<br/>
wearing shining golden crown, <br/>
sitting under the shadow of a white canopy.<br/>
I come from that Potiya hills.<br/>
<br/>
17. O amme! <br/>
the lovely, round breasts of the goddess <br/>
are decorated with diamonds.<br/>
<br/>
The young fish-eyed goddess <br/>
as lovely as a green fertile creeper,<br/>
gave birth to Murugan <br/>
who has twelve arms <br/>
and wears the garland of victory.<br/>
<br/>
Our innocent little girl Valli<br/>
has wide large eyes. <br/>
We gave her in marriage to<br/>
young Murugan<br/>
who has fragrant hair.<br/>
I come from that great gypsy family. <br/>
<br/>
18. O amme! <br/>
we dig the dirt <br/>
and take the valli roots that<br/>
grow under the flourishing creepers.<br/>
<br/>
We select kurinji flowers<br/>
and make garlands <br/>
stringing them together with <br/>
mullai blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
We drink the sweet juice <br/>
squeezed from the fruits, <br/>
mixed with honey.<br/>
<br/>
We happily wear the clothes <br/>
made of green tender leaves <br/>
and bark of trees.<br/>
<br/>
We feed our guests,<br/>
delicious food made of <br/>
millet flour and sweet honey.<br/>
<br/>
We sleep on the bed made from <br/>
the skin of an angry tiger.<br/>
<br/>
When we get up, <br/>
before we go to work<br/>
we worship the feet<br/>
of the fish-eyed goddess. <br/>
See amme, <br/>
this is the tradition of our gypsy family.<br/>
<br/>
19. O amme! <br/>
In our mountain, <br/>
the cruel tigers look at <br/>
the tender deer with kindness.<br/>
<br/>
Pounding stones used to crush   <br/>
new millet and grains, stay <br/>
on the patio of every house.<br/>
<br/>
The tigers with lines on their backs, <br/>
sleep in the mountain caves with elephants.<br/>
<br/>
The white water falls drop down<br/>
from the dark mountain <br/>
with roaring sound.<br/>
<br/>
Some nets and many ropes hang <br/>
on a pole in front of our patios.<br/>
<br/>
Small tudi drums <br/>
and large drums are beaten <br/>
and their sounds echo <br/>
in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
The deer cubs and the baby elephants <br/>
play together in our back yards.<br/>
Such is the  kurichi village <br/>
where the people <br/>
of our gypsy family live.<br/>
<br/>
20.  O amme! <br/>
<br/>
the gypsy of Palani hill, Murugan<br/>
married our girl Valli.<br/>
He is the son of Shiva,<br/>
the gypsy of the silver hills.<br/>
Our family gave<br/>
Palani hills, our kingdom<br/>
to the groom Murugan.<br/>
<br/>
What a large dowry for the groom!<br/>
We became poor now.<br/>
There is no oil for  <br/>
our children's hair, <br/>
or new clothes for their waists.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my husband, the gypsy man<br/>
brought a new wife, that thief !<br/>
Now there is no porridge <br/>
for my husband or for me now. <br/>
<br/>
21. O amme! <br/>
I have been to various <br/>
pilgrimages ---<br/>
Kudal, Punavaayil,<br/>
Piraan malai, Thirupparangundram, <br/>
Kutraalam,Thirumaappanur, <br/>
Puvanam, Thirunelveli, Edaham,<br/>
Aadaanai, Thirukkaanapper, <br/>
Thiruchuliyal,<br/>
Raameswaram and Thirupputtur.<br/>
<br/>
I have  been to <br/>
the Tamil Pandyan country, <br/>
ruled by our fish-eyed goddess.<br/>
I love the Pandyan country <br/>
and other countries as my own.<br/>
<br/>
I wandered around many hills<br/>
and forests and told kuri.<br/>
This is the way <br/>
I have spent my life.<br/>
If I do not do this, <br/>
my husband will not get any porridge.<br/>
<br/>
22. O amme!  <br/>
my grandmother, lovely as a blooming creeper,<br/>
is the younger sister of Valli, <br/>
who is decorated with golden bracelets.<br/>
My grandmother told me <br/>
that the earth goddess  <br/>
stays shinning on the chest <br/>
of the handsome god Vishnu.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother also told me that <br/>
Saraswathi, the goddess of all arts, <br/>
is the elder sister of my mother and <br/>
she stays on the divine tongue of <br/>
Brahma who stays on a Lotus.<br/>
<br/>
Indrani, the beautiful wife <br/>
of Indra embraces him.<br/>
She is our mother <br/>
who gave birth to us.<br/>
<br/>
There is no limit to all the kuris <br/>
that I have told people.<br/>
In front of the Kannimaar, <br/>
I promise, I do not lie.<br/>
Whatever we,<br/>
the gypsies say, will come true.<br/>
<br/>
23. O amme! <br/>
on the day Thadaadagai was born,<br/>
looking at her face I said that <br/>
she will rule the whole world.<br/>
<br/>
Another day, I looked at her palms<br/>
and said that god Shiva <br/>
will be her husband.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the signs on her body, <br/>
I said that she will give birth to a boy <br/>
and he will become a king.<br/>
<br/>
All the kuris that <br/>
I have said will happen.<br/>
Now I will tell you <br/>
all the thoughts in your mind.<br/>
Listen, amme. <br/>
<br/>
24. O amme! your eyes are sharp <br/>
like spears in a battle.<br/>
<br/>
Give me porridge for one time,  <br/>
some oil for my little hair <br/>
and one dress.<br/>
I will tell you all <br/>
that you have in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
I will look into your future, <br/>
present and past carefully.<br/>
I will tell you <br/>
what will happen in your future.<br/>
It is not a hard thing <br/>
for our gypsy families <br/>
to tell one's future.<br/>
<br/>
25. O amme,<br/>
making a paste mixed <br/>
with sandal and kumkum, <br/>
smear the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Decorate the floor with a lovely kolam<br/>
and spread fragrant smoke over the place.<br/>
<br/>
Place nine types of precious jewels <br/>
and many golden things<br/>
all around four directions<br/>
of the kolam.<br/>
<br/>
Place a statue of Ganesa <br/>
in the Southern corner<br/>
and decorate him  <br/>
with fragrant flower garlands <br/>
and arugam grass.<br/>
<br/>
Pour pure ghee into the lamps, <br/>
that brighten the place <br/>
and place a pot full of grains there.<br/>
<br/>
Worship in your heart, the queen of women,<br/>
the fish-eyed goddess, sweet as nectar.<br/>
<br/>
26. O amme,<br/>
measure three measures of Paddy<br/>
and three handful of paddy,<br/>
and bring it.<br/>
<br/>
Place a measure of paddy in a winnow. <br/>
and place it in the front of the worship.<br/>
<br/>
I split one measure of <br/>
that paddy into three parts.<br/>
I wanted to count them as two pairs, <br/>
but it became one pair and one part?<br/>
<br/>
Even before I think of him, <br/>
god Ganesa of Velvi hills,<br/>
came and risen here.<br/>
Whatever you wish, will be fulfilled <br/>
within the time of one blinking his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
This is the promise I make.<br/>
Our family goddess, the virgin ones<br/>
know that my kuri will never go wrong.<br/>
You will see.<br/>
<br/>
27. O amme,  <br/>
when you measured the paddy,<br/>
the lizard that stays in the right corner<br/>
gave us a good prophesy.<br/>
<br/>
See, Words of chase women <br/>
and sneezing are all <br/>
signs of good luck indeed.<br/>
<br/>
The hooting of an owl <br/>
that lives on a beautiful branch   <br/>
is a sign of good luck. <br/>
<br/>
28. O amme,<br/>
show me your palms, show me.<br/>
<br/>
Your palms measure precious gold <br/>
and nine types of jewels.<br/>
<br/>
If you pick flowers swarming with bees, <br/>
your soft hands may hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Your hands give nine types of wealth<br/>
to the poor who suffer.<br/>
<br/>
Your hands as beautiful as blooming lotuses,<br/>
will embrace the arms of the god Chokkanaadar.<br/>
<br/>
Your hands worship <br/>
the goddess of the world, <br/>
our queen of Madurai, <br/>
the fish-eyed goddess.<br/>
<br/>
29. O amme, <br/>
when I hold your lovely palms in my hands,<br/>
the  kuri says that Abhisheka Chokkar <br/>
will give his grace to you <br/>
and embrace you.<br/>
<br/>
When I worship the west folding my hands, <br/>
the kuri says that Shiva will come <br/>
and join you in the evening.<br/>
See, when I put my hands on your hands, <br/>
the kuri says that <br/>
all your wishes will be fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
O amme, <br/>
when I put my hands <br/>
on your beautiful abdomen, <br/>
the kuri says that <br/>
you will get sixteen children.<br/>
<br/>
30.  The prosperous lines<br/>
on your hands tells me  <br/>
that you will be rich.<br/>
<br/>
The good luck lines on your hands <br/>
tell me that you will embrace <br/>
the handsome majestic arms <br/>
of the king of southern Madurai.<br/>
<br/>
I have not seen such great lines <br/>
on the hands of any other than you.<br/>
You also have a mark of fortune on your arms<br/>

Worship the fish-eyed goddess.<br/>
All your wish will become true.<br/>
