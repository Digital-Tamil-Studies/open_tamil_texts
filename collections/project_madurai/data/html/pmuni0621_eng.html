THE WORLDLY AZHVARS<br/>
Divyaprabandham  - Seven Azhvars  <br/>
You are the sweetness in milk.<br/>
You are the brightness of precious gold.<br/>
You are the freshness of green moss.<br/>
You have the dark color of bees <br/>
that drink honey and fly around the ponds.<br/>
You are the four seasons. <br/>
How is it that the world cannot understand the nature of the god Maal? (795)<br/>
<br/>
INTRODUCTION<br/>
<br/>
The Seven Azhvars in this volume are Periyazhvar, Aṇḍal/Thalaivi, Kulasekharazhvar, Thirumazhisaiyazhvar, Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍiyazhvar, Thiruppaṇazhvar, Madhurakavi Azhvar.<br/>
<br/>
There is much information about Vaishnavism and the Azhvars’ lives found on the internet. My concern in this book is to provide a good translation of the pasurams. I hope this work will be helpful for academic scholars, students who do research on the Azhvars and anyone who is interested in the Divyaprabandham. This is my own work and if there are any mistakes, they are my responsibility. I hope you will enjoy reading this great work of Azhvars. <br/>
<br/>
According to Tamil scholars the Vaishnava Bhakthi movement dates from the 5th century CE to the 10th century. 4000 poems (pasurams) were composed by twelve Azhvars who called their god Maal, Neḍumaal, Thirumaal, Kanṇṇan and Nambi. The name Vishnu is not found in the text. (The word Viṭṭu is found in one Pasuram. Does it mean the god is arguable? As much as I know there is no grammar rule for Vishṇu changing to Viṭṭu.). <br/>
<br/>
“The god” in this translation means Thirumaal. “Gods” in the plural refers to other gods. The word Shiva is not used by the Azhvars. Shiva is mentioned as, “the one who has a crescent moon on his jaṭa,” “the one who has Ganges in his jaṭa,” “the one who has three eyes,” “the one who has a dark neck.” etc. This translation uses the word “Shiva” so that the readers will understand who the god is. In a very few places the word Brahma is used, but more often the word “Nanmuhan” is used for Brahma. For Indra the Azhvars use the phrases like, “the king of the gods” and “the thousand-eyed one.” The translation may use “Indra” for clarity. The word Lakshmi is not used in the pasurams, rather, “goddess on the lotus,” “beloved of the god,” “the one who stays on the chest of the god” and similar epithets are used for her. I used the word for this goddess ‘Lakshmi’ for the sake of the readers. Nappinnai, who is considered as Lakshmi, appears in the Pasurams often. <br/>
<br/>
Other uses are as follows: “Maayan,” “Maayanar,” “Maayavan” and the like refer to Maal (Vishnu). Nambi is another name often used by the Azhvars for Vishnu. When the Azhvars say, “emberuman,” “embiran,” my translation uses phrases like “dear one,” “dear god,” “highest god,” “god of gods” and the like. <br/>
<br/>
At the end of a masculine proper nouns, many derived from Sanskrit, the Azhvars use the Tamil -an ending while Sanskrit uses just -a. In order to retain a Tamil flavor, I have used the -an ending on most of these (“Asuran”) but have retained the Sanskrit usage for some names like Rama to accord with common usage.<br/>
<br/>
Phonetics. For the names of gods, kings, Rakshasas, cities, plants, flowers and animals I have often transliterated Tamil terms, using the following scheme:<br/>
<br/>
The vowels a, i, u, e, ee, o, ai, au are used in the translation. ‘aa<br/>
is used sometimes for clear pronunciation. <br/>
Consonants. Tamil writing system has eighteen consonants. <br/>
k,ch, ṭ, th, p, ng, nj, ṇ, n, m, (n), y, r, ṛ, l, v, ḷ and zh. <br/>
Soft consonants hg, j, ḍ, d, and b are used for pronunciation. <br/>
<br/>
Pronunciation. Nasals and medial sounds have only one pronunciation: ng, nj, ṇ, n and m. y, r, ṛ, v, l, ḷ and zh. The stops k, ch, ṭ, th, and p are unvoiced when they occur initially in a word. In the middle of a word in between vowels, they are pronounced as unvoiced stops. In the middle of the word if they are unvoiced stops, Tamil writing indicates these with double letters. The soft consonants h/g, s, ḍ, d, b are voiced and occur in the middle of a word between vowels. The Tamil writing system indicates these with single letter between vowels. The soft consonants may also occur after a nasal: ngg, nj, ṇḍ, nd, and mb.<br/>
<br/>
Some proper names often used are as follows.<br/>
Names of the gods: Kaṇṇan, Naraṇan, Narayaṇan, Kesavan, Govindan, Gopalan, Shridharan, Vasudevan, Baladeven, Madhavan, Nanmuhan (Brahma), Hanuman. <br/>
Names of kings: Janakan, Dasharathan, Nandagopan, Ravaṇan, Vibhishaṇan, Mahabali.<br/>
Names of Raksasas: Kamsan, Hiraṇyan, Sakaṭasuran, Thenuhan, Narahan, Muran, Ashṭasuran, Kabithasuran. <br/>
Names of Rakshasis: Thaḍahai, Puthana.<br/>
Names of goddesses: Thiru, Thirumagaḷ, Nappinnai. <br/>
Names of women: Devaki, Yashoda. Vaidehi.<br/>
<br/>
The 10 avatharams are fish, turtle, boar, Vamanan, man-lion, Rama, Parasuraman, Balaraman, Krishna, and Kalki. <br/>
<br/>
Divyadesams: The Vaishnavaites believe that the Azhvars praised 108 temples, which are called the Divyadesams. Many of these are also names of cities. In other cases, one city might have two, three or more Divyadesams (temples) in it. The Azhvars also call these Thirupadis. The tradition says Thirumangai Azhvar praises the god Maal in 108 Thirupadis. The internet has a list of all the Divyadesams. 105 of the Divyadesams are in India, one is in Nepal and the last two are Thirupaṛkadal (the ocean of milk) and Sri Vaikuṇṭam (Vishnu’s paradise). <br/>
<br/>
Some of the stories of Vishnu in the Divyaprabandham are listed here. There are many others could be found in the Pasurams. <br/>
1. 	His fight in Lanka with Ravaṇan<br/>
2. 	Killing Sakaṭasuran who came in the form of a cart, <br/>
3. 	Killing Kalingan the snake.<br/>
4. 	Stopping the storm with Govardana mountain.<br/>

<strong> Praising the god</strong> <br/>
<br/>
1. Let us praise the god and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!”<br/>
He, colored like a blue sapphire,<br/>
conquered his enemies with his strong arms.<br/>
We praise him forever, forever and forever <br/>
and for many crores of years.<br/>
Protect us as we are beneath your divine feet.<br/>
<br/>
2. Let us praise the god and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!”<br/>
Let us live never apart from his devotees and him.<br/>
Let us praise the beautiful Lakshmi<br/>
seated on the right side of his strong chest. <br/>
Let us praise the beautiful shining discus in his right hand.<br/>
Let us praise the Panchajanyam conch<br/>
that he blows on the battlefield. <br/>
<br/>
3. Let us praise the god and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!”<br/>
O devotees, if you wish to serve him, <br/>
come and carry sand and fragrance for his festivals.<br/>
If you concern yourself only with food, <br/>
we will not think of you as  one of our devotees. <br/>
We are from families <br/>
that have not sinned for seven generations. <br/>
He fought and destroyed <br/>
the Rakshasas and their land Lanka.<br/>
Let us praise him.<br/>
<br/>
4. Let us praise him and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!”.<br/>
Come and join us to do service to him. <br/>
If you realize always that your soul is he, <br/>
there is nothing you need to think of to go to him. <br/>
Praise, singing, “Namo, Nārāyaṇa!”<br/>
in all towns and in all countries. <br/>
O devotees, come and praise him with us.<br/>
<br/>
5. O devotees, worship and praise Rishikesa, the king of the whole earth,<br/>
who destroyed the Rakshasas and their large clan. <br/>
Give up your old ways and join us<br/>
and recite the thousand names of him. <br/>
Bow to his feet and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!”<br/>
<br/>
6. Let us praise him and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!”<br/>
My father, his father and his grandfather,<br/>
for seven generations they all worshipped him and served him<br/>
who took the form of Narasimha <br/>
on the evening of Sravaṇa Nakshatram day and destroyed Hiraṇyan, <br/>
and let us praise him.<br/>
<br/>
7.  We brand our shoulders<br/>
with the divine discus that shines like fire. <br/>
For many generations we have served him at his temple<br/>
who fought with Bāṇasuran with a thousand arms <br/>
and a magical army,<br/>
killing him with his discus making all his arms bleed.<br/>
Let us praise that strong god and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!”<br/>
<br/>
8. O divine lord, you gave me prasadam with good ghee, <br/>
betel leaves and nuts, ornaments for my neck, <br/>
earrings for my ears and sandal paste to smear on my body.<br/>
You gave me your grace <br/>
so that I would become pure and wise and serve you.<br/>
Let me praise you with  the Garuḍa banner<br/>
and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!” <br/>
<br/>
9. We, his devotees, wear the silk clothes he has worn, <br/>
put on the thulasi garland like the ones that adorn him, <br/>
eat the food that is left over after he eats,<br/>
and do the service everywhere that he desires from us. <br/>
On the days  of the Sravaṇa festival,<br/>
we praise him who rests on the snake bed<br/>
and say, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!” <br/>
<br/>
10. From the morning of each day we serve him as his slaves <br/>
and we will do the same in all our lives <br/>
and in future generations<br/>
praising him who will release us from birth and give us moksha. <br/>
He was born on the auspicious Sravana day.<br/>
He  broke the bow of Kamsan in northern Madhura,<br/>
and danced on Kalingan the five-headed snake .<br/>
Let us praise and say, “Pallaṇḍu, Pallaṇḍu!”<br/>
<br/>
11. Dearest god, I am an old devotee of yours, <br/>
like Abhimānadungan, the king of beautiful Koṭṭiyur<br/>
where there is no injustice. <br/>
Devotees praise you who are pure in all ways<br/>
with many names and say, “Namo Nārāyaṇa” with love. <br/>
I will praise you and say, “Pallāṇḍu Pallāṇḍu”<br/>
<br/>
12. Vishṇuchithan of Villiputhur praised the highest, <br/>
the pure one with the bow Sarngam.<br/>
If devotees recite these pāsurams and worship him saying, “Namo Nārāyaṇa” <br/>
they will be with the highest lord, praising him always<br/>
and saying, “Pallāṇḍu! Pallāṇḍu!” <br/>

<br/>
<strong>Periyāzhvar’s Pillaithamil on Kaṇṇan : The birth of Kaṇṇan</strong><br/>
<br/>
13. Kaṇṇan, Kesavan, the lovely child,<br/>
was born in Thirukkoṭṭiyur filled with beautiful palaces. <br/>
When the cowherds sprinkled oil <br/>
and turmeric powder mixed with fragrance<br/>
on each other in front of Kaṇṇan’s house <br/>
they made the front yards of the houses muddy. <br/>
<br/>
14. When cowherds heard that the divine child was born, <br/>
they ran, fell and shouted in joy. <br/>
They searched for the baby and asked everyone, <br/>
“Where is our dear one?” They beat the drums, sang, danced <br/>
and joy spread everywhere in their village.<br/>
<br/>
15. When the glorious child was born <br/>
the cowherds entered with love into Yashoda’s house,<br/>
saw him and praised him, saying,<br/>
“See! Among all men there is no one equal to this child. <br/>
He was born under the Thiruvoṇam star<br/>
and will rule the world.”<br/>
<br/>
16. The women of the cowherd village<br/>
took the pots from the uṟi,<br/>
rolled them in front of their houses and danced.<br/>
The fragrant ghee, milk and yogurt spilled all over<br/>
and they were crazy with joy <br/>
and their thick soft hair became loose. <br/>
<br/>
17. When the cowherds with pots,<br/>
sharp mazhu weapons,  staffs for grazing the cows <br/>
and  palm-leaf beds to lie on<br/>
heard that the divine child was born, <br/>
joined happily together <br/>
and laughed with their jasmine-like teeth.<br/>
They smeared oil on themselves <br/>
and jumped into the water to bathe. <br/>
<br/>
18. The cowherdess Yashoda massaged <br/>
the baby’s hands and legs<br/>
and gently poured fresh turmeric water on his body <br/>
from the pot and bathed him. <br/>
When she cleaned his lovely tongue, he opened his mouth <br/>
and she saw all the seven worlds inside. <br/>
<br/>
19. When the baby opened his mouth, <br/>
the beautiful cowherd women saw the worlds inside, <br/>
wondered and praised him, saying,<br/>
“This is not a cowherd child.<br/>
He is the supreme lord, This wonderful child is really the Māyan!” <br/>
<br/>
20. The cowherds planted poles of victory <br/>
in all directions on the twelfth  day after the child was born<br/>
and gave him a name of the god who lifted up the huge Govardhana mountain, <br/>
and they carried him in their arms and rejoiced.<br/>
<br/>
21. Yashoda said, “If I put him in the cradle, <br/>
he will kick and tear the cloth.<br/>
If I take him in my hands, he will hurt my waist.<br/>
If I embrace him tightly, he will kick my stomach.<br/>
I don’t have strength anymore to deal with him. <br/>
I am tired, my friends!”<br/>
<br/>
22. Vishṇuchithan, wearing a shining sacred thread,<br/>
composed pāsurams that describe <br/>
the birth of omnipresent Nārāyaṇan, Purushothaman<br/>
of Thirukkoṭṭiyur, surrounded with flourishing paddy fields.<br/>
If devotees recite these pāsurams all their sins will go away. <br/>

Thālelo, you took the form of a dwarf<br/>
and measured the world and the sky, thālelo.<br/>
<br/>
45. O lord, you hold all lives within you. <br/>
Kabali, Shiva the bull-rider sent you a golden ornament<br/>
studded with precious diamonds for your waist<br/>

with pomegranate flowers for a waistband. <br/>
Do not cry, do not cry. thālelo, <br/>
you measured the world for Mahābali, thālelo.<br/>
<br/>
46. O dear lord with the goddess Lakshmi on your handsome chest,<br/>
the king of the gods Indra brought musical anklets<br/>

<br/>
47. The gods in the sky came and gave<br/>
a valampuri conch, musical kolusu for your divine feet,<br/>
round bangles for your beautiful hands, <br/>

O lion-like son of Devaki, thālelo, thālelo.<br/>
<br/>
48. The god  Vaishravanan, Kuberan, <br/>
generous to all without discriminating, <br/>
thought that a beautiful aimbaḍaithali <br/>
and a necklace would be suitable<br/>

He brings them, stands away from you and worships you. <br/>
Thālelo, your body is as beautiful as a blue sapphire, thālelo.<br/>
<br/>
49. Varuṇan  thought that a necklace <br/>
made of shining pearls born in a roaring ocean, <br/>

You are decorated with a shining crown, thālelo,<br/>
and you have handsome arms, thālelo. <br/>
<br/>
50. The divine Lakshmi seated on a lotus that drips honey<br/>
sent you a garland of forest thulasi <br/>
and a garland of karpaga flowers <br/>
that bloomed in the fertile grove in the sky <br/>

turmeric for your bath, kohl for your beautiful large eyes<br/>
and red kumkum to decorate your forehead. <br/>

<strong>Ambulipparuvam  - Yashoda calls the moon to come and play with Kaṇṇan <br/>
</strong><br/>
54. As he crawls and plays in the sand making himself dirty,<br/>
the chuṭṭi ornament on his forehead swings around<br/>
and the golden kiṇgiṇi bells on his feet ring loudly.<br/>
O young beautiful moon! If you have eyes on your face, <br/>
come here and see the mischievous play of my son Govindan.<br/>
<br/>
55. My small dear child, sweet as nectar,   <br/>
calls you with his small hands, pointing to you again and again. <br/>
If you really want to play with the dark-colored one, do not hid in the clouds. <br/>
O lovely moon, come running happily to play with him.<br/>
<br/>
56. Even though you are surrounded by a shining wheel of light<br/>
and you spread light everywhere, <br/>
whatever you do, you cannot match the beauty of my son’s face.<br/>
O lovely moon, come quickly. <br/>
My clever son, the lord of the Venkaṭam hills  is calling you. <br/>
Don’t make him keep pointing at you and hurt his hands. <br/>
O lovely moon, come running happily to play with him.<br/>
<br/>
57. As I hold him on my waist, <br/>
my son opens his flower-like eyes wide<br/>
and calls you as he points to you with his sweet fingers. <br/>
O bright moon, if you know what is good for you, don’t try to fool us.<br/>
You aren’t someone who doesn’t know<br/>
how precious a child is. Come and see him.<br/>
<br/>
58. He calls you loudly with his prattling words<br/>
that come from his beautiful nectar-filled mouth.<br/>
You move and don’t stop even when the beautiful one,<br/>
the god Sridharan who is in all, calls you again and again.<br/>
Does that mean that your ears are stopped up<br/>
and you cannot hear if someone calls you?<br/>
Tell me, O wonderful shining moon. <br/>
<br/>
59. Our dear lord with  a club, a discus <br/>
and a conch in his strong hands<br/>
wants to rest and yawns. <br/>
If he doesn’t rest,  he can’t digest the milk that he drank. <br/>
O lovely moon, you are merely wandering in the sky.<br/>
Run and come quickly to him. <br/>
<br/>
60. Don’t ignore him thinking he is just a little boy. <br/>
He  slept on a banyan leaf in the ancient time, <br/>
and if he gets mad at you, he will jump on you and catch you. <br/>
Don’t disrespect him. He is Thirumāl. <br/>
O lovely moon, run and quickly come happily.<br/>
<br/>
61. Don’t ignore him thinking that he is a small child.<br/>
See, he is like a young lion. <br/>
Go and ask the king Mahābali <br/>
about the few words that Vāmaṇan spoke to him . <br/>
If you make a mistake and think he isn’t strong,<br/>
you will soon be needing his help.<br/>
O full moon, Neḍumāl calls you to come to him soon. <br/>
<br/>
62. He  took a lot of butter from the pots with his small hands <br/>
and swallowed as much as he wanted<br/>
and his stomach is full and looks like a pot.<br/>
If you don’t come when he calls you loudly, <br/>
he will throw his discus at you—<br/>
there is no doubt about it. <br/>
O lovely moon, if you want to survive, run and come happily.<br/>
<br/>
63. Vishṇuchithan, the poet from  flourishing Villiputhur<br/>
composed these Tamil pāsurams<br/>
that describe how Yashoda<br/>
whose large eyes were decorated with kohl <br/>
called the moon to come to play with her son. <br/>
If devotees recite all these pāsurams,<br/>
they will have no trouble in their lives.<br/>

When Indra the king of gods was angry with you <br/>
because you ate the food that the cowherds had kept for him<br/>

onto Kabithāsuran when he stood disguised as a wood-apple tree<br/>

<strong>
Yashoda wants to put a “kāppu” on Kaṇṇan to protect him from evil eyes.<br/>
</strong><br/>
192. Indra, Nānmuhan, Shiva and all other gods <br/>
brought beautiful divine flowers, <br/>
stood away from you and looked at you happily .<br/>
You abide in Veḷḷaṛai where the moon shines above the palaces <br/>
and the dancers sing your praise while they dance.<br/>
Come, beautiful child, it is evening <br/>
and I will put a kāppu on you <br/>
to save you from evil eyes. . <br/>

and their mothers cry out and call them.<br/>
I am tired of calling you, heartless one!<br/>
Don’t stay on the streets, it is getting dark.<br/>
You are the god of Thiruveḷḷaṛai surrounded by walls.<br/>
Listen! I’m saying this for your own good.<br/>
Come and I will put kāppu on you<br/>
to save you from evil eyes. <br/>
<br/>
194. When you knocked over the play houses<br/>
and messed up the play food of the girls <br/>
with soft breasts that are formed like ceppus, <br/>
I scolded you and now you have run away<br/>
and haven’t come back to eat.<br/>
You, the ruler of the world, <br/>
stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai where rishis live <br/>
and the gods praise you three times a day.<br/>
I won’t do anything to hurt you.<br/>
O beloved child, come and I will put kāppu on you <br/>
to save you from evil eyes. <br/>
<br/>
195.You bother everyone you see.<br/>
 Countless children come again and again <br/>
and they complain that you threw sand into their eyes <br/>
and kicked them. <br/>

and you are the light of wisdom.<br/>
I will praise your beautiful body.<br/>
Come and I will put kāppu on you to save you from evil eyes. <br/>
<br/>
197. I heard that Kamsan is angry at you <br/>
and is sending Putanā, the dark red-haired devil, <br/>
to cheat and kill you.<br/>
You stay in the beautiful Thiruveḷḷaṛai <br/>
that is surrounded by walls <br/>
and filled with diamond-studded palaces <br/>
over which the clouds scud.<br/>
I am afraid you will be hurt even if you stay there.<br/>
O beautiful child, come and I will put kāppu on you <br/>
so that evil eyes will not harm you. <br/>
<br/>
198. O beloved, my prince,<br/>
you stay in flourishing Thiruveḷḷaṛai.<br/>
I know that you kicked and killed the evil Sakaṭāsuran <br/>
when he came disguised as a cart.<br/>
You destroyed the two Asurans <br/>
when they came in the form of marudu trees.<br/>
I know you killed the devil Putanā, <br/>
drinking milk from her breasts,<br/>
but I don’t know what else you might have done after that. <br/>

come and I will put kāppu on you <br/>
so that evil eyes will not harm you. <br/>
<br/>
199. You are the god of  Thiruveḷḷaṛai <br/>
surrounded with precious golden walls.<br/>
You gave me the highest joy. <br/>
Even the gods do not know who you are. <br/>

and you were Yama for cruel Kamsan,<br/>
You have been raised as a precious child. <br/>
See, there is a beggar, a Kambakkabāli wearing a garland of skulls.<br/>
Run, come quickly and I will put kāppu on you <br/>
so that evil eyes will not harm you. <br/>
<br/>
200. You stay in prosperous Thiruveḷḷaṛai <br/>
and the Vediyars, skilled in the Vedas, <br/>
recite the Rg Veda, come holding conches <br/>
with water and stand near you.<br/>
O dear child, don’t be proud! <br/>
You stand in the middle of the street <br/>
and refuse to listen to my words.<br/>
I, your mother, only want to put divine kāppu on you.<br/>
It is evening.<br/>
I will light the lamp so I can see you when you return.<br/>

made Yashoda’s words into pāsurams.<br/>
If devotees recite even one part of these pāsurams<br/>
their bad karma will disappear. <br/>

<strong>The complaining cowherd girls!<br/>
</strong><br/>
202. The cowherd girls complain saying,<br/>
“When he gulps down the butter in our house<br/>
and throws the pots on the stones<br/>
we hear the noise of them breaking.<br/>
We can’t stop his naughty deeds. <br/>
You should take care of your son.<br/>
The things he does hurt us<br/>
as if someone were pouring sour juice into wounds.<br/>
You should tell your son not to act like that. <br/>
You gave birth to a son <br/>
whose actions are very naughty. <br/>
You are the mother of the chief of the whole world,<br/>
O lovely Yashoda. Call your son!”<br/>
<br/>
203. Yashoda talks to Kaṇṇan and her neighbors. <br/>
“You are my dear child!<br/>
As the dwarf Vamanan, you went to the king Mahābali.<br/>
Come, come, come here!<br/>
You are the best of the Kahusta dynasty,<br/>
with dark hair, a beautiful face and a lovely mouth. Come here. <br/>
And you, lovely neighbors, you know he is my beloved child,<br/>
know how precious he is to me. <br/>
Listen, son with a body dark as kohl,<br/>
it hurts me when I hear the neighbors complain about you.<br/>
I can’t bear it. Don’t you feel sorry for me? Come to me.”<br/>
<br/>
204. The cowherd women complain to Yashoda and say,<br/>
“Your wonderful son doesn’t hesitate to do naughty things.<br/>
He thinks it is just fine to do them.<br/>
He swallowed all the melted ghee in our pots and broke them<br/>
and now he stands here as if he has done nothing wrong.<br/>
Is it right to do bad things like this to your neighbors?<br/>
Yashoda, call him to come to you.<br/>
He doesn’t allow us to live! <br/>
No doubt, he is indeed Madhusudanan.”<br/>
<br/>
205. Yashoda asks Kaṇṇan to come to her and says,<br/>
“O you with the dark color of a cloud, come,<br/>
god of Srirangam, come, divine Naraṇan of Thirupperur<br/>
surrounded by the ocean with clear waves, come.”<br/>
He came running into the house and said,<br/>
“I’ve only come to eat.”<br/>
Yashoda could not get angry at him.<br/>
She approached him and embraced him.<br/>
This is the loving trick <br/>
that Yashoda’s dear child has learned.<br/>
<br/>
206. A cowherdess complains,<br/>
“I milked the cow and put the milk on the stove,<br/>
but I found out I didn’t have any fire to light it. <br/>
I asked my daughter to stay there <br/>
and went to borrow some fire from a neighbor.<br/>
As I stood there and chatted with the neighbor for a while,<br/>
the dear lord of Sāḷakkirāmam turned over the pot,<br/>
drank the milk and ran away. <br/>
O beautiful Yashoda<br/>
with a voice as sweet as the juice from a sugarcane press,<br/>
call your son.” <br/>
<br/>
207. Yashoda calls  Kaṇṇan to come to her.<br/>
“ O my son, you should come to me.<br/>
You should come to me now.<br/>
Don’t say you won’t come. Come to me. <br/>
The neighbors keep complaining about you<br/>
and it’s hard for me to hear so many complaints.<br/>
You are a happy little one!<br/>
You  carried Govardhana mountain<br/>
and danced the Kuḍakkuthu dance. <br/>
You are the meaning of the Vedas <br/>
and my god of Venkaṭa hills. Come here.”<br/>
<br/>
208. A cowherd girl complains, <br/>
“I made twelve types of sweets with good rice, <br/>
small lentils, sugar, fragrant ghee and milk <br/>
for the festival of Thiruvoṇam.<br/>
I know what he does—<br/>
he already ate my food once before. <br/>
He said he wanted more and gobbled everything up <br/>
and stood as if he hadn’t done anything wrong. <br/>
O lovely Yashoda, call your son <br/>
and ask him to come to you.<br/>
I only have a little bit of food left over.”<br/>
<br/>
209. Yashoda calls Kaṇṇan to come to her.<br/>
“O Kesava, come here. <br/>
Don’t say no. Come to me.<br/>
Don’t go to unfriendly people’s houses and play there.Come to me.<br/>
Don’t stay where common people <br/>
say bad things about you and servants live.<br/>
Obeying your mother’s words is your duty. <br/>
Damodara, come here.”<br/>
<br/>
210. A cowherd girl complains, <br/>
“ I kept sweet laḍḍus, seeḍais and sesame sweet balls in a pot and went outside. <br/>
I thought no one would come into my house<br/>
and take anything, but your son entered my house <br/>
and ate all the sweets without leaving any at all.<br/>
He even looked into the pot hanging on the uri <br/>
and checked to see if there was any butter hidden there.<br/>
O Yashoda, beautiful one, call your son to come to you.<br/>
I’ve only told you some of the naughty things he did.”<br/>
<br/>
211. A cowherd girl complains, <br/>
“If anyone complains about your son, you get upset.<br/>
O lovely Yashoda, he is tricky. <br/>
He came to our house and called my girl,<br/>
took her bracelets, went away through the backyard, <br/>
sold them to the berry seller<br/>
and bought some sweet berries and ate them.<br/>
When I asked him about the bracelets, <br/>
he said, “I haven’t seen them” and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
212. The chief Paṭṭar, Vishṇuchithan, composed songs<br/>
describing the play of the god of Srirangam in the southern land<br/>
surrounded with groves where bees happily swarm <br/>
and the Kaveri flows with its abundant water. <br/>
If people sing these songs and dance<br/>
they will become devotees of Govindan <br/>
and will be like lights that brighten up all the eight directions. <br/>
I bow to them and worship their feet.<br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
<strong>
The complaints of the young cowherd girls <br/>
</strong><br/>
213. O Yashoda, your son threw mud at us <br/>
when we were bathing and playing in the river. <br/>
He stole our bracelets and clothes<br/>
and ran faster than the wind and hid in his house. <br/>
When we asked for our clothes and bangles <br/>
he didn’t answer. This isn’t fair.<br/>
If he doesn’t give us our bangles it isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
214. O Yashoda, your son who has long hair, <br/>
long ear rings,<br/>
and a sacred thread hanging down to his belly button <br/>
is worshipped and praised by people in all eight directions. <br/>
We are beautiful women and our hair is decorated <br/>
with flowers that swarm with bees.<br/>
Your son stole our clothes and climbed to the top of a tree<br/>
that touches the sky and sat there. This isn’t fair. <br/>
We begged him to give our clothes back, but he wouldn’t. This isn’t fair. <br/>
<br/>
215. O Yashoda, your son stirred up the water in the pond <br/>
where large lotuses bloom,<br/>
grasped the tail of the poisonous snake Kalingan <br/>
and climbed on its heads, dancing and shaking its whole body. <br/>
We think that was good, <br/>
but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree<br/>
and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
216. O Yashoda, your son killed the Asuran Thenuhan, <br/>
threw his body at the tree,<br/>
and made the fruits of the palmyra tree fall.<br/>
When Indra made a heavy rain fall on the cattle,<br/>
he carried Govardhana mountain in his big arms<br/>
and protected the cows. We think that was good, <br/>
but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree,<br/>
and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
217. O Yashoda, when your son stole the milk and yogurt <br/>
in the cowherd village and ate them, <br/>
the cowherds saw him, caught him and tied him up.<br/>
Now he can’t steal the butter <br/>
made by the cowherd women with round bamboo-like arms <br/>
because they tied him up and spanked him so he cried. This isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
218. O Yashoda, even when he was a baby <br/>
toddling with his tiny feet, <br/>
that young child knew in his mind <br/>
that the devil Putanā would come, cheat him and try to kill him.<br/>
When she came, he drank poisonous milk from her breasts and killed her. <br/>
We think that was good,<br/>
but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree<br/>
and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
219. O Yashoda, he went to the sacrifice of king Mahābali,<br/>
asked for three feet of land,<br/>
and measured this earth with one foot <br/>
and the sky with the other foot. <br/>
We think that was wonderful,<br/>
but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree<br/>
and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
220. O Yashoda, your son, the god of gods in the sky, <br/>
came riding on his vehicle, the Garuḍazhvar <br/>
and removed the suffering of Gajendra the elephant<br/>
when he was caught by a crocodile in the large pond<br/>
blooming with cool screw pine plants and ambal flowers,<br/>
killing the crocodile with his discus.<br/>
We think that was wonderful,<br/>
but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree,<br/>
and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
221. O Yashoda, your son with the color of a cloud in the sky<br/>
grazes the cows in the forest and plays happily.<br/>
He took the form of a boar, went beneath the earth <br/>
brought the earth stolen by an Asuran and put it back. <br/>
We think that was wonderful,<br/>
but he stole our clothes, stays in the top of the tree,<br/>
and refuses to give them back. This isn’t fair.<br/>
<br/>
222. Paṭṭan, the chief of Puduvai, <br/>
composed pāsurams describing the complaints <br/>
of the beautiful cowherd women to Yashoda<br/>
about the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan. <br/>
If devotees recite these pāsurams<br/>
they will have no troubles in their lives.<br/>
--------<br/><br/>
<strong>
Kaṇṇan, Yashoda and the cowherd women<br/>
</strong><br/>
223. He toddles and comes to me <br/>
just like thousands of other children.<br/>
I give him butter precious as gold and milk.<br/>
He drinks the milk and embraces me. <br/>
He, the king, drank milk<br/>
from the breasts of the cheating devil Putanā<br/>
with a waist as thin as lightning and killed her.<br/>
Dear child, I know who you are<br/>
and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
224. I gave a bath to your sky-blue body <br/>
and fed you food sweet as nectar and went out. <br/>
Before I came back you killed the Asuran <br/>
when he came as a fully-laden cart<br/>
and returned to stay quietly at home. <br/>
You changed the mind of a young girl <br/>
with a waist thin as lightning and made her love you.<br/>
Dear child, I know who you are <br/>
and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
225. You swallowed all the butter and the lentils in the pots<br/>
and turned over the yogurt pot and ate all the yogurt.<br/>
Now, after killing the Asurans disguised as marudam trees, you come.<br/>
O best among men! <br/>
You can do all these miraculous things. <br/>
People say you are my son,<br/>
but dear child, I know who you are<br/>
 and I’m afraid to give you food. <br/>
<br/>
226. You fascinate the beautiful young cowherd girls<br/>
whose dark eyes are decorated with kohl. <br/>
You follow them holding onto their soft clothes<br/>
and steal their clothes and stand away. <br/>
You do many mischievous things. <br/>
You tell lies and people are gossiping about you. <br/>
I heard a lot about you near the pond.<br/>
Dear child, I know who you are <br/>
and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
227. You swallow the butter and the yogurt <br/>
that the cowherd women churn three times a day and keep. <br/>
You make the pots that the cowherds<br/>
carry on their shoulders fall and drink the yogurt.<br/>
You sob and sob like the children <br/>
who want to drink milk from their mothers.<br/>
Dear child, I know who you are <br/>
and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
228. When an Asuran came as a calf<br/>
and refused to eat the good paddy<br/>
that all the other cows were eating happily<br/>
on the flourishing fields humming with bees,<br/>
you knew it was not a calf.<br/>
You threw him up, made the vilam fruits fall and killed him.<br/>
O naughty one, you wander about and plot <br/>
to make a young girl whose soft curly hair is filled with bees <br/>
fall in love with you. <br/>
Dear child, I know who you are <br/>
and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
229. You are light! <br/>
You go into the grove and play soft music <br/>
on your flute, enthralling everyone.<br/>
The cowherd girls with soft curly hair come <br/>
and surround you to listen to you playing music <br/>
and worship you.<br/>
O dear child, my only fault is that I have raised you.<br/>
You are naughty and the cowherd women <br/>
are always complaining about you, <br/>
but I know who you are <br/>
and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
230. Even if you keep quiet<br/>
without doing anything naughty,<br/>
people don’t believe it. <br/>
You fascinate the beloved daughters of others,<br/>
embrace and enjoy them,<br/>
and do things one can’t speak of.<br/>
No matter what I say about you, <br/>
the cowherd families don’t listen.<br/>
They blame me because of you<br/>
until I can no longer listen to all their complaints.<br/>
You, son of Nandan, are like a bull.<br/>
I know who you are and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
231. Cowherd mothers go to sell buttermilk,<br/>
cowherd fathers go behind the cows to graze them,<br/>
and you, fearless, run behind the lovely village girls. <br/>
You wander around and everyone who sees you<br/>
says how naughty you are.<br/>
You do things to please even those who don't like you. <br/>
You are my dear child. I know who you are and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
232. You went into a blooming garden with a young girl <br/>
with hair is adorned with a bunch of flowers, <br/>
embraced her breasts adorned with pearl chains, <br/>
and stayed there with her all night. <br/>
You only returned after the night was gone <br/>
and came at dawn. <br/>
If people want to gossip about you <br/>
I let them say what they want. I won’t shout at you.<br/>
Dear child, I know who you are<br/>
and I’m afraid to give you food.<br/>
<br/>
233. Yashoda with fragrant flowers in her hair<br/>
called the dark one colored like a cloud<br/>
and told him that she will give him food sweet as nectar, <br/>
not just any food. <br/>
Paṭṭarpiran, the chief of Puduvai, <br/>
the famous poet praised by the whole earth,<br/>
composed pāsurams with Yashoda’s words.<br/>
If people recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will become the devotees of Rishikesa. <br/>
<br/>
234. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I bathed the dear kohl-colored child of the cowherd clan<br/>
in turmeric water and sent him out to go behind the calves<br/>
because I didn’t want him wandering from house to house.<br/>
But how could I send my child who fought Kamsan<br/>
without worrying that his ankleted feet would hurt<br/>
as he went behind the calves?<br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
235. Yashoda says, “I don’t want my son to go wandering around <br/>
kicking and destroying the play houses <br/>
of lovely doll-like girls <br/>
with bodies adorned with fragrant turmeric powder. <br/>
I don’t want him going around doing naughty things. <br/>
Why have I sent him behind the calves to the forest <br/>
where hunters go with their axes? <br/>
Why did I send my child behind the calves?<br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
236. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I don’t want my son wandering <br/>
and playing every day with young girls<br/>
decorated with beautiful maṇimegalai ornaments.<br/>
I don’t want him making his shining golden body dirty with mud.<br/>
That’s why I’ve sent my sapphire-colored son<br/>
to go behind calves on the forest paths <br/>
where the bells of the cattle ring out.<br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
237. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I don’t want him wandering around <br/>
in this cowherd village doing naughty things<br/>
so the beautiful dark-haired women there come <br/>
and gossip about him.<br/>
He, the god beyond  all thought is sweet to the eyes of all. <br/>
I have sent him to the forest behind the calves to graze them. <br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
238. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I don’t want him wandering here and there <br/>
in the cowherd village doing naughty things.<br/>
I don't want him approaching the cowherd girls <br/>
and kissing them with his lips that are like kovvai fruits. <br/>
I’ve sent that divine one, the king of gods,<br/>
behind the calves to the forest <br/>
where hunters carry afflicting bows. <br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
239. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I don’t want him stealing butter, <br/>
filling his mouth and swallowing it <br/>
and doing many other naughty things <br/>
as he wanders around in this cowherd village.<br/>
I’ve sent him behind the calves to the forest paths<br/>
where many elephants wander and people trip and stumble.<br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
240.Yashoda says, <br/>
“I don’t want him jumping around, <br/>
playing and wandering about with his friends<br/>
as women with vine-like waists gossip about him. <br/>
I’ve sent the lord of Garuḍa behind the calves<br/>
to the hot forest paths where there are dry kaḷḷi plants.<br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
241. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I carried him on my hip for twelve months<br/>
and fed him nectar-like milk from my young breasts.<br/>
Now I have sent my young lion-like son, behind the calves to the dry forest <br/>
where he will hurt his golden feet.<br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
242. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I have sent my son Damodaran behind the calves<br/>
without giving him an umbrella and sandals to go in the terrible forest<br/>
where broken, hard, rough stones will hurt his feet.<br/>
Cruelly, I have sent my son to the forest. <br/>
What a terrible thing I have done!”<br/>
<br/>
243. Paṭṭan, the chief of Puduvai<br/>
filled with palaces that shine like gold<br/>
composed a garland of sweet Tamil pāsurams <br/>
that describe how Yashoda was worried<br/>
when she sent her sweet sapphire-colored son to graze the calves. <br/>
If devotees recite these pāsurams<br/>
they will have no difficulties in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
244. Yashoda says, <br/>
“The young Kaṇṇan adorned with a kudambai flower <br/>
for an earring on his one ear<br/>
and a red thondri blossom on the other,<br/>
with a lovely kachu around his waist, a checked dress on his body<br/>
and a chest adorned with a precious pearl chain goes behind the cattle.<br/>
Come and see the beautiful form of the ocean-colored lord. <br/>
O lovely women, I am the only one<br/>
with a precious son like him on this earth. There is no one like me.”<br/>
<br/>
245. Yashoda says, <br/>
“You are the eternal, famous Madhusudanan, <br/>
and you stay in Srirangam surrounded with good strong walls<br/>
where the Kaveri river flows and groves bloom.<br/>
O Kesava, I have done wrong. <br/>
I fed you a little food and heedlessly sent you<br/>
on your tiny feet to graze the young calves<br/>
because I thought it would be good for you.<br/>
No woman has a harder heart than I.<br/>
O small one, give me a kiss.” <br/>
<br/>
246. Yashoda says, <br/>
“O Damodara, you are the beloved of Nappinnai, lovely as a peacock.<br/>
You go through the forest,<br/>
graze the calves, run behind them and return,<br/>
wearing koḍal flowers that bloom in the rainy season. <br/>
Now see, your body is covered with dirt.<br/>
I have made water ready for your bath.<br/>
Take a bath and come to eat.<br/>
Your father hasn’t eaten yet. He will eat with you.”<br/>
<br/>
247. Yashoda says, <br/>
“You stay in the beautiful Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
filled with fragrant groves! <br/>
You are a strong bull that fights in terrible battles.<br/>
O dear child, I brought you an umbrella, sandals and a flute<br/>
but you went without taking them <br/>
and your small red lotus feet <br/>
that went behind the calves have blistered.<br/>
Your eyes are red and you are tired, dear child!”<br/>
<br/>
248. Yashoda says, <br/>
“:You are a bull in battle!<br/>
When you blow the Panchajanyam conch <br/>
on the battlefield, your enemies shiver. <br/>
You, are the little lion of the cowherd clan, the beloved of Sita.<br/>
You are Thirumāl, small and short with lovely eyes.<br/>
You left your clothes and a small sword on your bed<br/>
and went to graze the cows with other cowherds<br/>
and it seems now you have returned with them.”<br/>
<br/>
249. Yashoda says, <br/>
“O beautiful lord with a shining discus in your hand,<br/>
I felt I might die when you entered the pond<br/>
and fought with the snake that spat poison.<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
You made my stomach hurt.<br/>
I am not worried.<br/>
What you did made Kamsan happy.<br/>
O lord, you have the dark color of a kāyām flower.”<br/>
<br/>
250. Yashoda says, <br/>
“You who, colored dark like the sea, rest on the milky ocean <br/>
took the forms of a boar, a turtle and a fish.<br/>
When the cunning Asuran came as a calf<br/>
to the field where cows were grazing, <br/>
you took him in your small hands <br/>
and threw him at the vilam fruit trees. <br/>
Those Asurans always do only evil things to my son.”<br/>
<br/>
251. Yashoda says, <br/>
“I just heard something that is new to me.<br/>
It seems you ate the rice, curries and yogurt<br/>
that the cowherds made and kept for Indra<br/>
mixing them together. <br/>
I’m not good enough to feed you.<br/>
I’ll never be able to do it.<br/>
O Vasudeva, your fame is faultless. <br/>
From now on, I will be frightened of you.”<br/>
<br/>
252. Yashoda says, <br/>
“You carry a strong white conch in your hand.<br/>
It is the auspicious Thiruvoṇam day, your birthday.<br/>
I called some women whose words are like music,<br/>
planted bean seeds and blessed you, <br/>
praying that you may live for many years. <br/>
I made curry and rice to celebrate your birthday.<br/>
O dear child, don’t go tomorrow to graze the calves.<br/>
Dress and decorate yourself and stay here.” <br/>
<br/>
253. Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Puduvai <br/>
where faultless people live<br/>
composed ten pāsurams that describe<br/>
how the cowherdess Yashoda<br/>
saw her son coming after grazing the calves.<br/>
If devotees learn these pāsurams and sing<br/>
they will approach the ankleted feet of the ocean-dark lord. <br/>
<br/>
254. Decorated with fresh leaves and garlands,<br/>
cowherds come while the sounds of flutes and songs<br/>
are heard everywhere while drums are beaten.<br/>
Govindan, his hair adorned with peacock feathers, <br/>
comes with them<br/>
and young women, coming to their doorsteps, <br/>
see the cowherds and Kaṇṇan and say,<br/>
“Is a cloud coming in the crowd?”<br/>
They forget what they should do <br/>
and stand there, forgetting even to eat.<br/>
<br/>
255. Kaṇṇan, wearing a soft garment<br/>
that looks like the petals of flowers blooming on a vine,<br/>
carrying a small sword, <br/>
and adorned with a garland made of fragrant mullai <br/>
and vengai blossoms mixed with fresh kachandi leaves<br/>
comes in the middle of a group of cowherds in the evening. <br/>
O girls, if you go before him, you will lose your beautiful bangles. <br/>
<br/>
256. His young friends wearing silk garments <br/>
run behind him carrying small swords, bows, chendus and sticks. <br/>
One of them blows a conch so the cows will hear and return.<br/>
Kaṇṇan, tired, comes with them. <br/>
My daughter sees his beautiful body<br/>
adorned with turmeric powder and approaches him.<br/>
The people of the village see and gossip about her. <br/>
<br/>
257. He, my beloved one, carried Govardhana mountain<br/>
and protected the cows when there was a big storm.<br/>
Now he plays music on his flute as a cowherd,<br/>
grazes the calves and comes with his friends.<br/>
O beautiful friend, I see him on the streets.<br/>
I have not seen anyone like him before. <br/>
O friend, come and see him. <br/>
All my bangles are getting loose<br/>
and my young breasts beneath their blouse are not in my control. <br/>
<br/>
258. I saw the cowherds carrying umbrellas<br/>
made of peacock feathers standing around Kaṇṇan<br/>
wearing beautiful peacock feathers in his hair.<br/>
They sang and danced in front of their doorsteps. <br/>
I don’t want you to give me in marriage to anyone<br/>
except Māyan, the lord of Thirumālirunjolai. <br/>
You should realize that I belong only to the victorious one <br/>
and give me in marriage to him.<br/>
If you don’t, it will plunge into sorrow. <br/>
<br/>
259. He will be wearing a shining sinduram<br/>
and a perfect nāmam on his divine forehead.<br/>
The lovely music of flutes and the sound of drums will play. <br/>
With the cowherds carrying their grazing sticks<br/>
he will come into the flourishing grove.<br/>
He is a cowherd child, yet he is the eternal god<br/>
and he will walk on the street as if he knows everything. <br/>
Let’s stop him and tell him that he stole our ball<br/>
and see the lovely smile on his coral mouth. <br/>
<br/>
260. Kaṇṇan goes behind good cows in a flourishing grove<br/>
with his divine body shining brightly,<br/>
his fragrant hair decorated with peacock feathers.<br/>
His beautiful lotus eyes shining,<br/>
he comes among a group of cowherd children, <br/>
plays the flute, sings songs and dances, <br/>
as the cowherds come with him singing and dancing. <br/>
My daughter is fascinated seeing the beauty of that cowherd child.<br/>
<br/>
261. He is adorned with a poṭṭu made of red powder and <br/>
a divine nāmam on his forehead. <br/>
Wearing beautiful peacock feathers in his hair,<br/>
the cowherd child comes like Indra, the king of the gods.<br/>
I told my daughter, “If you go in front of him, you will lose your bangles.”<br/>
My beautiful girl stands before him in the middle of the street,<br/>
and see, her bangles and clothes are becoming loose.<br/>
<br/>
262. On his left ear he wears a lovely thondri flower<br/>
and his long hair is adorned with jasmine and forest mauval flowers. <br/>
My daughter sees the beauty of the cowherd child <br/>
as he comes playing his flute and she falls in love with him.<br/>
She stands before him without moving<br/>
and see, her lovely bangles become loose and she grows thin.<br/>
<br/>
263. Vishṇuchittan, the chief of Puduvai <br/>
surrounded with lovely groves where bees swarm,<br/>
composed ten pāsurams about the love of the cowherd girls <br/>
when they see Kaṇṇan, the god of the gods, <br/>
coming on the street of the cowherd village <br/>
surrounded by cows and children.<br/>
If devotees sing these songs happily, <br/>
they will reach divine Vaikuṇṭam.<br/>
---------<br/><br/>
<strong>Govardhana mountain<br/>
</strong><br/>
264. The victorious umbrella-like mountain <br/>
that the dark ocean-colored lord <br/>
who ate a pile of rice with lentils, yogurt and ghee<br/>
carried to protect the cows <br/>
is Govardhana where gypsy girls<br/>
feed good milk to the round-eyed innocent fawns <br/>
that were caught by their husbands and given to them. <br/>
<br/>
265. The victorious umbrella-like mountain <br/>
that Madhusudhanan carried to stop the rain <br/>
when Indra, the king of gods was angry <br/>
and made it rain for seven days,<br/>
hurting the innocent cows,<br/>
is Govardhana where a female elephant chased by a young lion,<br/>
afraid her cub may be hurt and protecting it under her legs, <br/>
opposes the lion and fights. <br/>
<br/>
266. The victorious umbrella-like mountain that our father<br/>
with a shining discus in his hand<br/>
carried when the cows, the large-eyed cowherd women <br/>
and the cowherds screamed and asked for help saying, <br/>
“Help us, you are our refuge!"<br/>
is Govardhana where men with strong mountain-like arms <br/>
bend their bows when their lovely doll-like women<br/>
ask them to catch deer, saying,<br/>
“See, a group of deer are grazing on our millet.”<br/>
<br/>
267. As Kannan picked up Govardhana mountain<br/>
where the clouds gather<br/>
after descending to the ocean, <br/>
scooping up the water, rising to the sky in the east <br/>
and pouring down rain,<br/>
he was like a mahout giving a ball of rice<br/>
to a cruel-eyed elephant.<br/>
<br/>
268. The victorious umbrella-like mountain that our father,<br/>
who once took the form of a boar, carried,<br/>
digging it up and calling the gods, saying,<br/>
“O gods in the sky! <br/>
If anyone among you is strong enough, tell me,<br/>
and come carry this with me!”<br/>
is Govardhana where a happy forest elephant<br/>
that has lost its tusks raises its trunk, worships <br/>
and asks him to give the crescent moon for his tusk <br/>
as the musth pours from his temples. <br/>
<br/>
269. The victorious umbrella-like mountain <br/>
that our wonderful Thirumāvalavan carried, <br/>
putting all the five fingers of his lovely lotus hand <br/>
at its base and lifting it with his large, beautiful arms<br/>
is Govardhana where the water<br/>
of the white waterfall flows everywhere <br/>
as it carries lovely glistening beautiful pearls<br/>
and makes the hill look like a treasure of pearl garlands.<br/>
<br/>
270. The victorious umbrella-like mountain <br/>
that our Damodaran carried <br/>
using the five fingers of his wide hands<br/>
just as the thousand-headed Adishesha carries the earth<br/>
is Govardhana where the monkeys live <br/>
and put their small children to sleep <br/>
holding them in their hands<br/>
and singing the fame of Hanuman <br/>
who went to Lanka and destroyed its pride. <br/>
<br/>
271. The victorious umbrella-like mountain <br/>
that Narayaṇan carried to protect the cows <br/>
when the strong rain fell<br/>
like a warrior using his shield to stop <br/>
the arrows coming at him like a heavy rain<br/>
is Govardhana where pious rishis practice tapas<br/>
living in huts roofed with leaves, while angry murderous tigers<br/>
go and sleep with them.<br/>
<br/>
272. The victorious large mountain that Damodaran carried<br/>
who drank milk from the breasts of the terrible devil Putanā and killed her<br/>
is Govardhana that has the same name as the god Govardhanan.<br/>
There monkeys carrying their babies on their backs,<br/>
climb on the branches of trees and teach them how to jump.<br/>
<br/>
273. When the beautiful blue-colored one <br/>
carried Govardhana mountain,<br/>
the fingers of his lotus hands did not loose their beauty<br/>
and his strong beautiful finger-nails did not hurt.<br/>
He carried the mountain as if it were something he did every day. <br/>
On victorious umbrella-like Govardhana mountain, <br/>
a group of large clouds that rest on the top of the hills<br/>
make the mountain look as if it has grey hair<br/>
as they pour down rain everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
274. The famous Paṭṭarpiran Vishṇuchithan <br/>
where the Vediyars recite the divine Vedas<br/>
composed these ten pāsurams on Govardhana mountain<br/>
where jasmine flowers bloom on the branches of kuravam trees. <br/>
He describes how the hill is carried as an umbrella <br/>
by the god who rests on Adishesha <br/>
and rides on an eagle, the enemy of snake.<br/>
If devotees recite those pāsurams in their hearts<br/>
and worship him, they will reach divine Vaikuṇṭam. <br/>
----------<br/><br/>
<strong>Kaṇṇan plays the flute<br/>
</strong><br/>
275. O beautiful girls of this wide world, hear a wonderful thing!<br/>
When Thirumāl with a white valampuri conch in his hand<br/>
plays the flute with his divine lips,<br/>
the cowherd girls with young breasts <br/>
hear the sound of the flute, are excited, <br/>
shiver and run away from their houses <br/>
where they are guarded,<br/>
untying the ropes that they bind them<br/>
and putting those ropes on their necks as if they are garlands.<br/>
Shyly they come and surround him.<br/>
<br/>
276. When Govindan takes his flute in his hands, <br/>
bends his eyebrows, blows the air from his stomach and plays,<br/>
young doe-eyed girls as beautiful as peacocks listen. <br/>
Their hair decorated with flowers becomes undone, <br/>
their dresses become loose<br/>
and holding their falling dresses<br/>
they stand looking at him out of corners of their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
277. When the prince of the sky, the lord of Vaikuṇṭam, <br/>
the little one of Vasudeva, the king of Madhura, Govindan,<br/>
the princely son of Nandagopa<br/>
the little child of the cowherds plays his flute, <br/>
young Apsarases come down from the sky and approach him,<br/>
their hearts melting and their flower-like eyes shedding tears.<br/>
Their hair swarming with bees becomes loose, their foreheads sweat <br/>
and they close their ears to everything else <br/>
and hear only the music of his flute. <br/>
<br/>
278. When the small dark-colored Kaṇṇan <br/>
who fought, conquered and destroyed <br/>
the evil Asuras Thenuhan, Pilamban and Kaliyan <br/>
plays his flute wandering about in the forests,<br/>
Menaga, Thilothama, Ramba, <br/>
Urvasi and other heavenly Apsarases,<br/>
fascinated as they hear his music, are speechless<br/>
and come down from the sky, dancing and singing with joy.<br/>
<br/>
279. Madhusudanan, feared by the kings of the three worlds,<br/>
who came as a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan<br/>
When he plays the flute, Narada with his Tumburu veena, <br/>
and players of the kinnaram, the midunam and other string instruments<br/>
hear his music, forget their skills and say,<br/>
“We won’t touch our musical instruments <br/>
because we can’t compete <br/>
with the lovely music of Madhusudanan.” <br/>
<br/>
280. When our highest lord, a lion among the gods,<br/>
who was born to Devaki as a child <br/>
with large beautiful eyes and strong arms<br/>
plays his flute, <br/>
the Gandharvas wandering in the sky, <br/>
fascinated by the nectar-like music,<br/>
say, “He, the highest, is playing the flute,” <br/>
and, feeling ashamed because they can’t play like him, <br/>
they stand, join their hands and worship him. <br/>
<br/>
281. Listen to the wonders that I have seen on this earth! <br/>
When Kaṇṇan who has beautiful large eyes and strong arms<br/>
plays his flute in the middle of a crowd of young cowherds, <br/>
the music is heard in the world of the gods <br/>
and all the sky dwellers forget to eat their sacrificial food <br/>
and enter the cowherd village.<br/>
Their ears are filled with the sweetness of the music <br/>
and they follow happily wherever Govindan goes<br/>
and do not leave him at all. <br/>
<br/>
282. When Govindan plays the flute <br/>
holding it in his small fingers,<br/>
as his beautiful eyes close, his red cheeks puff out <br/>
and his brow sweats with small drops of water, <br/>
flocks of birds leave their nests, <br/>
come and surround him. <br/>
Herds of cattle leave the forest <br/>
where they graze, come near Govindan, <br/>
and lie down with their legs apart.<br/>
They bend their heads, listening to the music of the flute <br/>
and move their ears as if they are dancing.<br/>
<br/>
283. His dark color is like mass of clouds,<br/>
his face is beautiful like a red lotus, <br/>
and his dark curly hair has the color of bees.<br/>
When he plays his flute, <br/>
a herd of deer, fascinated with his music, forgets to graze <br/>
and grass that they have eaten hangs from their mouths<br/>
and, not swaying from side to side, <br/>
they stand motionless as if they were painted pictures.<br/>
<br/>
284. When the matchless one, <br/>
the chief of the cowherds <br/>
adorned with dark-eyed peacock feathers and a silk garment<br/>
tied tightly and beautifully on his handsome body, <br/>
plays the flute, <br/>
the trees stand without moving, <br/>
flowers pour down honey-like drops as if to bow and worship him<br/>
and straight branches bend to hear the music.<br/>
They all turn towards wherever the beautiful Thirumāl is<br/>
because that is their nature.<br/>
<br/>
285. Vishṇuchithan the chief of Puduvai composed pāsurams<br/>
about how music flowed like a flood of nectar<br/>
from the holes of the bamboo flute <br/>
in the beautiful hands of curly-haired Govindan <br/>
with a tuft on his head. <br/>
If those skilled in Tamil recite these pāsurams of Vishṇuchithan<br/>
they will be among the devotees of the god.<br/>
-------------<br/><br/>
<strong>The mother worries about her young daughter  <br/>
</strong><br/>
286. She plays on the sand and makes herself dirty.<br/>
She speaks like a baby.<br/>
She doesn’t know how to wear her lovely dress made with fine thread.<br/>
She has never gone out of our front yard with a small play pot in her hands,<br/>
yet holding the hands of the one<br/>
who rests on the snake Adisesha, she comes home.<br/>
<br/>
287. Her teeth have not grown out yet,<br/>
her hair is not yet thick,<br/>
and she plays with sparse-haired still innocent children.<br/>
But now she has made friends with naughty girls <br/>
and says that they are good children like her. <br/>
She has fallen in love with Māyan,<br/>
the beautiful sapphire-colored lord. <br/>
<br/>
288. Even when she tries to make a play house <br/>
on the white sand in the front yard of her house, <br/>
she cannot make it without drawing <br/>
pictures of a conch, a wheel, a club, a sword and a bow.<br/>
Her breasts have not grown out yet. <br/>
My heart worries every day <br/>
because she is in love with Govindan.<br/>
<br/>
289. Who can I tell about the tricks <br/>
that this young Kaṇṇan does? <br/>
He gets together with my young, innocent daughter’s friends <br/>
and cheats her and makes fun of her. <br/>
She doesn’t know the old saying<br/>
that the spoon that scoops the porridge <br/>
doesn’t know how much salt is in the porridge.<br/>
Just like that she does not know <br/>
whether the lord with a discus in his hand loves her<br/>
as much as she loves him.<br/>
<br/>
290. She wears fragrant thulasi garlands <br/>
and goes to all the cities and lands <br/>
where Narayaṇan stays and searches for him. <br/>
Many can’t understand her and want to hurt her.<br/>
Confused, they say, “Put her in a guarded place with Kesavan.”<br/>
Why is the world like this? <br/>
<br/>
291. I decorated her with a forehead ornament,<br/>
golden ear rings, a paḍagam ornament and anklets<br/>
and raised her with love,<br/>
but she doesn’t want to stay with me now.<br/>
She left me and just keeps saying, “Puvai puvanna!”<br/>
O girls with long thick hair, see, she is falling in love with him.<br/>
<br/>
292. I am an innocent mother and she is my innocent daughter.<br/>
She stands in front of the girls who obey their mothers<br/>
but she is like a spoon that gets loose from its stem and spills food <br/>
everywhere without knowing what it is doing.<br/>
Shameless, she mutters like a parrot and says, <br/>
“Kesava, you are faultless!”<br/>
O girls with long fragrant hair,<br/>
she is fascinated with him and has fallen in love.<br/>
<br/>
293. She wears pretty clothes and looks at herself in the mirror. <br/>
She makes the bangles on her arms jingle.<br/>
She wears a new sari and sighs.<br/>
She decorates her red mouth as sweet as a kovvai fruit.<br/>
She does the same thing again and again.<br/>
She raves about the power of him with a thousand names. <br/>
She falls in love with the sapphire-colored lord <br/>
who has no hatred for anyone.<br/>
<br/>
294. What is the use if I save abundant wealth and wish to spend it <br/>
to do auspicious ceremonies for her? It only hurts me.<br/>
She is like a tender shoot that grows on a field <br/>
and he is like the owner of that land.<br/>
He can do whatever he wants with her.<br/>
Take her to the place of the beautiful one<br/>
colored like a dark cloud and leave her there. <br/>
<br/>
295. We did all the auspicious ceremonies <br/>
that we were supposed to do for her <br/>
and kept her in our home thinking that she would stay there,<br/>
but she wants to do something else<br/>
and worries how she can leave home. <br/>
Before others know that she is in love with him <br/>
and is leaving home because her parents<br/>
have not arranged marriage for her,<br/>
we must take her to him <br/>
who went to Mahābali as a dwarf <br/>
and measured the world.<br/>
<br/>
296. Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Puduvai <br/>
surrounded with beautiful flower gardens<br/>
composed a garland of ten pāsurams <br/>
about how a mother describes her daughter's love <br/>
for Narayaṇan who swallowed the whole earth<br/>
and rests on a banyan leaf. <br/>
If devotees recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will have no trouble in their lives.<br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>A Mother's worry<br/>
</strong><br/>
297. I haven’t seen my daughter anywhere.<br/>
My house is empty. <br/>
It is like a pond that has lost its beauty <br/>
and its fresh lotuses have shed their petals <br/>
when the dew has fallen on them <br/>

giving food to others without hiding it <br/>
even if they need to sell whatever is in their hands for some money. <br/>
They praise him , saying, <br/>
“You are Kesavan, you are the Purshothaman,<br/>
you are a shining light, you are the dwarf.”<br/>
They would even sell themselves to do good <br/>
for the devotees of him. <br/>
<br/>
370. If those wandering without serving <br/>
as slaves to the ancient god in Thirukkoṭṭiyur <br/>
surrounded by fertile fields and flourishing water<br/>
recite without mistakes <br/>
the pāsurams of the faultless Paṭṭarpiran Vishṇuchithan <br/>
of beautiful Puduvai, <br/>
they will become the devotees of Rishikesa. <br/>
-----------<br/><br/>
<strong>Advising the people to worship god before the time of their death<br/>
</strong><br/>
371. Even if people have only thought<br/>
of their mothers, fathers, children, and wives with fragrant hair, <br/>
if they close their eyes when they are dying and praise the god and say, <br/>
“Kesava, Purushothama, <br/>
you became a boar and you are faultless,”<br/>
they are my dear friends, <br/>
and no words are enough for me to praise them.<br/>
<br/>
372. If people who were never the devotees of Nārāyaṇan<br/>
are sick and their wounds become putrid and swarm with flies,<br/>
and if, fainting and coming to the end of their lives,<br/>
they fold their hands and worship him, <br/>
saying “Namo Nārāyaṇa,”<br/>
they will never again go near people<br/>
who are not the devotees of Nārāyaṇan. <br/>
<br/>
373. If someone has collected and saved wealth<br/>
and if his relatives come to him before his death <br/>
and ask greedily,<br/>
“Tell us where you keep your wealth! <br/>
Tell us where you keep it!”<br/>
if he, without saying anything, <br/>
makes his heart a temple of Madhavan,<br/>
places the god there and sprinkles his love as flowers, <br/>
he will be saved even if a snake comes to bite him.<br/>
<br/>
374. When someone is old, <br/>
his breathing may become thin. <br/>
His neck will be swelling with air.<br/>
His legs and hands will be shaking.<br/>
If he says the mantra of one sound<br/>
before he closes his eyes<br/>
and thinks of him, he will go to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
375. Before someone comes to the time of his death <br/>
and the water he has drunk is spit out<br/>
and the food that he ate is vomited <br/>
and his eyes close,<br/>
if he praises god saying, “Rishikesa!”<br/>
on his way, the dogs will not come.<br/>
No one will hurt him with their spears.<br/>
He will not lose his wealth any time.<br/>
<br/>
376. Before someone loses the sense<br/>
of his eyes, nose, mouth, ears and touch, <br/>
and before his breath ceases, <br/>
and before he can no longer swallow the water <br/>
given to him from a conch, <br/>
and before his head sags to the side, <br/>
if he thinks in his heart of the Māyan Madhusudhanan <br/>
resting on the ocean, abundant with water, <br/>
there is nothing that he cannot achieve. <br/>
<br/>
377. Before the heartless messengers of Yama <br/>
enter someone’s home like kidnappers, <br/>
tie him with strong ropes and pull him away,<br/>
if he worships in his heart faultlessly <br/>
and says “O Madhusudana, <br/>
you are my king, I am your slave!” he will reach heaven.<br/>
<br/>
378. Before someone’s relatives gather together,<br/>
speak only of his good qualities and not his faults,<br/>
sing and sing,<br/>
and put him on a bier and take him to the burning ground <br/>
and leave him there in the forest <br/>
after putting new clothes on him, <br/>
if he sings, dances and worships the god Govindan<br/>
adorned with the Kausthubham ornament,<br/>
he will escape from Yama and join the god.<br/>
<br/>
379. Before someone cannot speak <br/>
and his weakening eyes shed water<br/>
and his mother, father and wife weep, <br/>
and before fire takes hold of his body, <br/>
if he worships the lord <br/>
and thinks of himself as the devotee of the lovely-eyed Thirumāl, <br/>
and if he thinks of the god as his relative, <br/>
he will escape from Yama’s messengers.<br/>
<br/>
380. Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Villiputhur, <br/>
composed ten pāsurams which say <br/>
that if people worship the lord and ask for his refuge<br/>
and become his devotees,<br/>
before Yama’s messengers come and take them<br/>
they will be able to reach god.<br/>
If people learn and recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will become devotees, thinking only of him..<br/>

<strong>
Advising the devotees about naming children with the names of god.<br/>
</strong><br/>
381. O poor ones! <br/>
You gave your children mean names of the rich <br/>
because you wanted to get money, <br/>
clothes with decorations and other things from them.<br/>
If you give the name of Kesavan and live worshipping him, <br/>
the god Nāraṇan will not send <br/>
the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
382. O poor ones! <br/>
You name your children the names of people <br/>
even if they are not good,<br/>
because you wish them to give you some clothes.<br/>
If you call your children,<br/>
“O lovely-eyed Neḍumāl, O Sridhara,”<br/>
Nāraṇan will not send <br/>
the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
383. Why did you name your children <br/>
with the names of those who give you oil <br/>
to put on your children’s hair, and give ornaments <br/>
and bracelets to decorate them?<br/>
Even if you have to live by begging,<br/>
you should give your children the divine name of our god Nārāṇan.<br/>
If you do, Nāraṇan will not send <br/>
the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
384. You will not be blessed in your next birth <br/>
if you give that child the name of another person than god.<br/>
If you call your child, <br/>
“O Madhava, king of heaven, Govinda,” <br/>
Naraṇan who is in all hearts will not send <br/>
the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
385. You will not be blessed in your next birth <br/>
if you give the name of another human<br/>
born from an unclean womb.<br/>
If you call him, saying, “O Govinda, Govinda!<br/>
You have been born in a good family!”<br/>
Nāraṇan who does only good things for all<br/>
will not send the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
386. Do not give human names to your children<br/>
like others joining with the people<br/>
of your country and town and celebrating with them<br/>
the name ceremony for their children. <br/>
Do not fall in the ditch like them. <br/>
If you approach the god and worship him saying, <br/>
“O Nāraṇa, you destroyed the Asuran when he came as a cart. <br/>
You are our chief, O Damodara!”<br/>
he will not send the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
387. O, ignorant ones! <br/>
Your children are human<br/>
and they were born from unclean bodies<br/>
and will return to the earth. <br/>
You gave them the name of people <br/>
and do not realize what you have done is not good.<br/>
Think of giving the name of the dark cloud-colored one <br/>
who is sweet to the eyes.<br/>
Approach Nāraṇan. <br/>
He will not send the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
388. If you give your children the names of village people<br/>
such as “nambi, pimbi,” those “manbu, pimbu”<br/>
will be forgotten in a few days. <br/>
If you give them the name of the lovely lotus-eyed lord, <br/>
O friends, Nāraṇan will not send the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
389. Giving the name of the dark cloud-colored god<br/>
to your children born in an unclean body<br/>
is like pouring nectar into a dirty ditch. <br/>
But if you wear the nāmam<br/>
and dance and sing the praise of Nāraṇan<br/>
who is never false to his promises, <br/>
he will not send the mothers of your children to hell. <br/>
<br/>
390. Vishṇuchithan from the ancient village of Veeraṇai, <br/>
is praised by all, always, <br/>
and he worshipped the divine name of Thirumāl.<br/>
He composed ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams about how people <br/>
should name their children with the names of the god. <br/>
If devotees recite these ten beautiful pāsurams <br/>
they will go to the divine splendid Vaikuṇṭam <br/>
and stay there happily forever. <br/>

<strong>Requesting the god to come and help when Yama’s messengers come. <br/>
</strong><br/>
423. When they are old, people go to others who are strong<br/>
because they believe they will help them.<br/>
Even though I am not worthy to approach you,<br/>
I come to you for refuge <br/>
because you saved the elephant Gajendra <br/>
from the crocodile when it seized him.<br/>
When I become old and my time comes to an end <br/>
and I am suffering, I may not be able even to think of you.<br/>
Now I have told you what my state will be then.<br/>
O lord, you rest on the snake bed on the ocean in Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
424. Look, you need to come and help me <br/>
when my time comes to an end,<br/>
O god  with a conch and discus in your hands.<br/>
The Kingarar, the messengers of Yama,<br/>
will come to take me and bring me terrible pain.<br/>
I worship you always.<br/>
Wherever you go, with your miracles you can prevent<br/>
any suffering that comes to anyone.<br/>

You should protect me from all trouble and take care of me.<br/>
O lord, you  rest on the snake bed on the ocean in Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>

and you rest on the snake bed on the ocean in Srirangam. <br/>

of you, the ancient lord praised with the syllable “Om.”<br/>
When the messengers of Yama come<br/>
terrifying me because they think my time is up, <br/>
you must come and protect me. <br/>
<br/>
427. You, the highest one <br/>
resting on Adishesha, the snake on the milky ocean, <br/>
made Nanmuhan on your navel<br/>
so that he could create all the creatures of the world,<br/>
and you also made Yama because you thought <br/>
that the lives of people in this world should not be endless.<br/>
O dear lord! You should protect me now. <br/>
<br/>
428. O god, you are the earth, ocean, fire, wind and the sky!<br/>
The Kingarars, the evil messengers of Yama <br/>
come and cruelly take people’s lives.<br/>
Whenever I have thought of you <br/>
I have recited all your names and worshipped you.<br/>
O my lord, think of me always and protect me.<br/>
O lord, you rest on the snake bed on the ocean in Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
429. O my father, you are the god of gods, <br/>
the meaning of the Vedas and their pure words,<br/>
you are my sweet faultless nectar,and the lord of all the seven worlds.<br/>

with their cunning forms, make me suffer and take me, <br/>
you must come to protect me and say, “Do not be afraid!”<br/>
O lord. you rest on the snake bed on the ocean in Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
430. I do not know any of the magic you do.<br/>
When the Kingarars, the messengers of Yama, come,<br/>
make me suffer and take me to Yama’s world, <br/>
I may not be able to think of you,<br/>
O god of the gods in the sky, O Māya,<br/>
born in Madhura, my soul is yours. You should protect me.<br/>
O lord, you  rest on the snake bed on the ocean in Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
431. You my lord, are the cowherd who grazed the cows<br/>
and carried Govardhana mountain to protected them. <br/>
You are the ancient light. <br/>
From the day I was born until today I have never forgotten you.<br/>
When the Kingarars, the cruel messengers of Yama, <br/>

you should come and protect me.<br/>
O lord, you  rest on the snake bed on the ocean in Srirangam.<br/>

they will become pure-minded<br/>
and will be devotees of the sapphire-colored lord.<br/>
-------------<br/><br/>
<strong>The poet's request <br/>
</strong><br/>
433. O Mādhava, because I do not know<br/>
how to say anything that is good I do not praise you<br/>
but still my tongue says nothing but your names.<br/>
I am afraid, nothing is under my control.<br/>
You may be angry with me <br/>
because you think I speak as someone ignorant, <br/>
but I cannot stop my tongue.<br/>
Great ones find meaningful things <br/>
even in the calling of crows.<br/>
You are the reason for everything,<br/>
O lord, with an eagle banner.<br/>
<br/>
434. I compose worthless pāsurams with my useless tongue.<br/>
You carry a conch and a discus in your hands. <br/>
Is it not the duty of the great to forgive the mistaken words of their servants? <br/>
My eyes can only see through your eyes<br/>
and my mind will not think of any other god except you. <br/>
I am like a deer—<br/>
one more dot on its coat does not spoil its loveliness.<br/>
Surely it is not too much for you to accept my mistakes.<br/>
O lord,  you swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out.<br/>
<br/>
435. I do not know what is good or what is bad,<br/>
all I know is to say, “Nāraṇā.”<br/>
Before, I said unworthy things about you <br/>
but now I only praise you. See, O Thirumāl, <br/>
I do not even know how to think of you. <br/>
Always I say, ‘Namo Nāraṇa, Namo Nāraṇa.”<br/>
My only strength is that I am a Vaishaṇavan <br/>
and live in your temple. <br/>
<br/>
436. You, the pure, tall god,<br/>
measured this world with your body.<br/>
Do not hesitate to make me your slave.<br/>
Though I do not want any clothes or food<br/>
I still have not became your slave<br/>
and am wandering here and there.<br/>
O lord, you  killed the cruel Kamsan<br/>
and cut the chains of Vasudevan, your father,<br/>
when he was in prison and released him.<br/>
<br/>
437. I have placed all my property, wife, cattle, waterways, <br/>
lands and wells and anything that I have <br/>
under your golden feet without any worry.<br/>
It is hard for me to deal with my villagers<br/>
because they are jealous that I own so much.<br/>
O lord, you who took the form of  a boar, <br/>
and dug up the earth to bring back the earth goddess<br/>
and broke the tusk of the elephant and killed it,<br/>
I need your help.<br/>
<br/>
438. O dear lord, dark colored creator<br/>
of the four-headed Nānmuhan<br/>
and the reason for everything,<br/>
even if I, your devotee, do not eat, I do not get hungry<br/>
because worshiping you takes my hunger away. <br/>
If there is a day when I do not think of you, <br/>
and do not always say, “Namo Nāraṇa” <br/>
and do not recite Rig and Sama Vedas<br/>
and do not place fresh flowers on your feet, <br/>
that will be the day I starve.<br/>
<br/>
439. You pretend to sleep <br/>
on the white flood of ocean on a snake bed,<br/>
but when I want to see you sleeping on the snake bed, <br/>
my heart becomes weak and I sob with happiness,<br/>
my hair stands on end, my eyes shed tears<br/>
and I cannot rest at all. <br/>
O tell me, how I can reach you.<br/>
<br/>
440. You carried the huge beautiful Govardhana mountain,<br/>
used it as an umbrella and protected the cowherds<br/>
and the cows from the storm. O Madhusudanan, Kaṇṇa,<br/>
who released the elephant Gajendra from his suffering<br/>
and killed the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam,<br/>
you, the reason for everything,<br/>
remove the troubles of your worshipers.<br/>
You are so famous that I do not have the words to praise you.<br/>
O my dear lord, give me your grace <br/>
so that I may approach you and worship you every day.<br/>
<br/>
441. You are my friend<br/>
and the god of those who praise you with love.<br/>
The god of the gods in the sky,<br/>
you took the form of a man-lion, you measured all the seven worlds,<br/>
and you are the apocalypse.<br/>
You, the reason for everything,<br/>
removed the suffering of the elephant Gajendra <br/>
when he was caught by a crocodile<br/>
and you churned the milky ocean with the gods in the sky. .<br/>
Make me your devotee and protect me.<br/>
I am weak—remove my suffering.<br/>
<br/>
442. He is Mādhavan and Madhusudanan,<br/>
the emerald-colored father of Kama, a lion to his enemies<br/>
who took the form of a dark-haired dwarf and is sweet for me. <br/>
Vishṇuchithan the chief of Puduvai<br/>
that flourishes with goodness<br/>
composed ten wonderful Tamil pāsurams on him. <br/>
If devotees recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will reach the world of Nāraṇan soon. <br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Asking diseases to go away because the god will protect the Azhvar and his devotees. </strong>
<br/><br/>
443. O diseases that stay and spread on our bodies<br/>
like the ants that swarm around the ghee pot and climb on it,<br/>
you go away and we want to become well. <br/>
The god of the Vedas entered into my body <br/>
and stays there lying on the snake bed. <br/>
It is not my old body.<br/>
God is there now and he protects it.<br/>
<br/>
444. The plan that Chitragupthan wrote <br/>
by the order of Yama, the king of the southern direction,<br/>
is canceled and the messengers of Yama<br/>
have run and hidden themselves, leaving me alone <br/>
because I am a slave of the devotees of the ancient god,<br/>
the all-knowing one resting on the ocean,<br/>
the lord of the wise and nectar for his devotees.<br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
God is in it now and he protects me.<br/>
<br/>
445. My lord who brought me from my mother’s womb <br/>
helped me control the desires of my five senses,<br/>
removed the craving of this body of nerves and flesh,<br/>
and kept the messengers of Yama <br/>
from binding me with ropes and taking me away. <br/>
He taught me to become his devotee night and day and serve him. <br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
God is in it now and he protects me. <br/>
<br/>
446. O diseases, you give pain to people <br/>
because of their bad karma,<br/>
but see, there is also bad karma for you.<br/>
Do not enter my body, do not enter it.<br/>
Do you see how it is not easy to enter my body?<br/>
Look, my body is the divine temple<br/>
where the lord who took the form of a man-lion stays. <br/>
Go away or you will be in trouble. <br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
He is in it now and he protects me. <br/>
<br/>
447. O diseases, I made Māyan<br/>
who took the form of a dwarf<br/>
enter my mind and I kept him there with love. <br/>
I have nothing else in my mind.<br/>
See, my mind is a precious treasure that keeps a diamond.<br/>
He is strong and he is mischievous. <br/>
Do not hesitate. Go away.<br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
God is in it now and he protects me. <br/>
<br/>
448. O diseases that bring suffering to people,<br/>
I will tell you something, listen.<br/>
My body is the divine temple of him who grazed cows.<br/>
Be careful or you will get bad karma. <br/>
There is nothing you can have here.<br/>
You should go away.<br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
God is in it now and he protects me. <br/>
<br/>
449. I was attracted, slipped and fell into the small cave<br/>
that is called a woman’s breast.<br/>
I plunged into it and could not get out. <br/>
My dear lord, colored like the shining ocean<br/>
removed my bad karma and saved me from my troubles.<br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
God is in it now and he protects me.<br/>
<br/>
450. Decorated with fine silk,<br/>
he came to me as a divine guru,<br/>
saved me from all my troubles, <br/>
entered my heart that is like a blooming lotus<br/>
and marked me with his foot on my neck behind my head.<br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
God is in it now and he protects me. <br/>
<br/>
451. Do not sleep, do not sleep, do not sleep, <br/>
O bright shining discus, do not sleep.<br/>
O conch, do not sleep.<br/>
O Nanthaka sword that follows the path of dharma, <br/>
do not sleep.<br/>
O beautiful Sarngam bow, do not sleep.<br/>
O mace, do not sleep. <br/>
O eight guardians of the world<br/>
who do not fail in your work, do not sleep.<br/>
O Garuḍa king of birds, do not sleep.<br/>
Watch my room when I rest, do not sleep.<br/>
My body is not the same as it was.<br/>
God is in it now and he protects me.<br/>
<br/>
452. I, the poet Vishṇuchithan, praise the lord <br/>
who came and entered my heart lying on his snake bed<br/>
on the beautiful milky ocean that has roaring waves<br/>
with Lakshmi, beautiful as a statue. <br/>
He rests on the ocean and I worship him <br/>
so that he will help me compose these pāsurams on paṭṭinam kāppu.<br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>Requesting the god of Thirumālirunjolai not to leave the devotee’s heart.<br/>
</strong><br/>
453. O father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai, <br/>
I released myself from the sufferings of this world, <br/>
became your devotee and saw you. <br/>
I will not allow you to leave my heart.<br/>
O lord, you came to this world <br/>
and were born from the womb of Devaki <br/>
as her seventh child after she had lost six children. <br/>
<br/>
454. I embraced you, keep you in my heart.<br/>
and will not allow you to leave me.<br/>
If you hide yourself with your magical tricks<br/>
I swear by you that what you do is not right.<br/>
You, my father, are lord of Thirumālirunjolai<br/>
surrounded with pure water<br/>
that removes the bad karma <br/>
of the people of all lands and all cities. <br/>
<br/>
455. I have done much tapas to serve you.<br/>
If I go to another god and serve him, <br/>
it will destroy your pride,<br/>
god of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
where a gypsy tribe plants grain in the earth,<br/>
grows new crops, worships you and says, <br/>
“We worship your golden feet<br/>
and eat the new grain.”<br/>
<br/>
456. O father, lord of Thirimālirunjolai,<br/>
I suffered wandering many miles in this life.<br/>
There is no shade for me here<br/>
and there is no water for me here. <br/>
I see no refuge that would let me survive <br/>
except the shade beneath your feet.<br/>
O god, you went as a messenger for the Paṇḍavas,<br/>
told lies to the Kauravas making them your enemies<br/>
and were the cause of the deaths of all those <br/>
who died on the battlefield in Kurukshetra.<br/>
<br/>
457. My feet do not have the strength to walk<br/>
and the tears from my eyes do not stop.<br/>
My body becomes weak and trembles.<br/>
I cannot speak. I shiver,<br/>
my arms are twisted and I can’t make them straight. <br/>
My mind is fascinated by you and thinks only of you<br/>
and I begin to praise you and live,<br/>
O my father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai<br/>
surrounded by springs where fish frolic.<br/>
<br/>
458. Shiva with his bull banner, <br/>
Nanmuhan, Indra and all others <br/>
do not know the cure for the sickness that is this birth.<br/>
You, beautiful like a bright sapphire,<br/>
are the healer who can cure the sickness that is birth.<br/>
O my father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai, <br/>
give me your grace so I may enter your world <br/>
and not be born again.<br/>
<br/>
459. I was plunged in the sufferings of this world <br/>
and now by your generous grace have been released from them.<br/>
I am tired. Please give me your grace and say to me,<br/>
“Don’t be afraid.” <br/>
O god of Thirumālirunjolai with a shining discus,<br/>
your hands are strong, your eyes are lovely,<br/>
you wear silk garments,<br/>
and your body has the color of the red evening sky. <br/>
<br/>
460. I thought I could see you today or tomorrow. <br/>
I suffered longing to see you <br/>
for many ages and many eons. <br/>
Now I will not leave you<br/>
who destroyed all the hundred Kauravas, <br/>
and gave life to their enemies the Pandavas, your brothers-in-law.<br/>
Don’t you know that my heart is with you,<br/>
O my father, god of Thirumālirunjolai?<br/>
<br/>
461. Even when I was in my mother’s womb <br/>
I wanted to serve you as a slave.<br/>
I was born in this world and I found you—<br/>
how could I leave you<br/>
who fought with Baṇasuran<br/>
and with your discus cut off his thousand arms,<br/>
scattering them in all the directions,<br/>
O my father, lord of Thirumālirunjolai.<br/>
<br/>
462. Vishṇuchittan the chief of Puduvai <br/>
that is filled with golden shining palaces, <br/>
composed pāsurams about the lord of Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
where people of the world go and play in the spring water. <br/>
If devotees recite these ten pāsurams <br/>
they will become devotees of the god who measured the world. <br/>
-------------<br/><br/>
<strong>The Azhvar describes the benefits he has received because god has entered into his heart.<br/>
</strong><br/>
463. You, Damodharan, the clever lord <br/>
of the rich, lofty Thiruvenkaṭam hills,<br/>
flourish and protect the world. <br/>
I put the mark of your discus on myself <br/>
and on all my possessions.<br/>
I live because of your grace.<br/>
What do you want me to do now?<br/>
<br/>
464. You are the highest god <br/>
who rides on the eagle Garuḍa.<br/>
After you possessed me <br/>
the ocean of my births dried up<br/>
and now I have reached the highest place.<br/>
My sins have burned up as if in a forest fire<br/>
and I have plunged into the river of nectar of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
465. You, the god of my family, my master, entered my heart.<br/>
Who could ever get the goodness that I have received?<br/>
All the sins of the world that made me suffer<br/>
have run away and hidden in the bushes.<br/>
<br/>
466. O lord with arms as strong as mountains<br/>
 and a discus and the bow saragam in your hands,<br/>
you are the servant of your devotees.<br/>
Like the gods when they churned the ocean of milk <br/>
and filled a pot with nectar, <br/>
I opened my mouth and filled my body with you<br/>
and my heart melted. Even cruel Yama<br/>
will not be able to come near my feet with his club.<br/>
<br/>
467. You are my father, my Rishikeshan,<br/>
and the protector of my life. <br/>
Like someone who brightens gold<br/>
by rubbing it on a touchstone, <br/>
through your grace I kept you faultlessly<br/>
and praised you with my tongue and in my heart.<br/>
. <br/>
468. You are Rāma and the best among men.<br/>
You carried an axe in your left hand <br/>
when you came to the earth as Balarāma to rule the world.<br/>
As if I were drawing on a wall,<br/>
I drew your form in my heart perfectly<br/>
and you came to me, O my dear one, <br/>
Don’t go anywhere leaving me.<br/>
<br/>
469. O lord who broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam, .<br/>
fought and defeated the wrestlers,<br/>
like the king of the Pandya country <br/>
who placed his mark on the mountains, <br/>
you placed your bright, divine feet on my head <br/>
and made me your own.<br/>
I have always praised your name with my good tongue.<br/>
<br/>
470. You, a tall one with a discus,<br/>
you came into my heart<br/>
along with Adishesha and Garuḍāzhvar,<br/>
stayed there and made me alive.<br/>
My heart melts when I think how you stay there,<br/>
tears fill my eyes and flow down<br/>
and I need only think of you for my sorrows to disappear. <br/>
<br/>
471. You left your snake bed on the cool ocean, <br/>
came running to me,<br/>
and now you stay in the ocean of my heart.<br/>
You who are my magical and beloved god, <br/>
the Māyan, the best of all <br/>
the beloved of Nappinnai, <br/>
a matchless ocean and a precious light <br/>
are the unique world.<br/>
You made my heart your abode and you own me.<br/>
<br/>
472. O, dear one, you, a light,<br/>
stay in my heart like a shining lamp<br/>
and are like a tall bright coral vine that grows on a large hill.<br/>
You did not want to stay in the northern ocean, in Vaikuṇṭam,<br/>
in Dwarapuri surrounded by walls, or in other places.<br/>
You left them all and came into my heart. <br/>
<br/>
473. Vishṇuchithan, born in the tribe of the Veyar,<br/>
praises him, the cowherd, <br/>
the beautiful cool cloud-colored lord,<br/>
the bull of the cowherds, <br/>
the king of gods and the nectar of the Andanars.<br/>
If devotees sing the pāsurams of Vishṇuchittan<br/>
they will reach him as his shadows.<br/>

2.  Aṇḍal.:   Thiruppāvai  (474 -503) </h3></center>
<strong>Girls waking up their friends. <br/>
</strong><br/>
474. The girls come and wake up their friends. They say, <br/>
“Today is the auspicious full moon day of Markazhi month. <br/>
O you adorned with beautiful ornaments,<br/>
let us go bathe. Come!<br/>
We are the beloved young girls of the flourishing cowherd village. <br/>
Nārāyaṇan,  the son of Nandagopan, <br/>
who  looks after the cows with a sharp spear, <br/>
the young lion of lovely-eyed Yashoda <br/>
with a dark body, beautiful  eyes <br/>
and a face bright as the shining moon <br/>
will give us the Paṛai. <br/>
Come and let us bathe and worship our Pāvai<br/>
as the world praises him.”<br/>
<br/>
475. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,<br/>
“O people of the world! <br/>
Hear how we worship our pāvai.<br/>
We worship the feet of the highest lord <br/>
resting on the milky ocean.<br/>
We don't eat ghee, we don't drink milk, <br/>
we bathe early in the morning,<br/>
we don't put kohl to darken our eyes,<br/>
we don't decorate our hair with flowers,<br/>
we don't do evil things, we don't gossip.<br/>
We give alms to all beggars and sages.<br/>
Come and let us be happy and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
 476. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say, <br/>
“Let us sing and praise the name of the virtuous lord <br/>
who measured the world with his tall form<br/>
and let us decorate our Pāvai and bathe it.<br/>
If we do that, rain will fall three times a month <br/>
without fail all over our land, <br/>
paddy in the fields will flourish,<br/>
fish will frolic in the fields,<br/>
bees will sleep on the buds of the kuvaḷai blossoms<br/>
and the cows will not hide their milk<br/>
but yield generously to fill up the pots<br/>
when the cowherds milk them. <br/>
Let riches be abundant! <br/>
Come and let us bathe and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
477. The girls come to wake up their friends. They  say, <br/>
“O Varuṇa, you  take water from the ocean. <br/>
Do not hide your rain.<br/>
O cloud,  you enter the ocean, scoop up water and rise, <br/>
looking like the dark form of the lord of the eon, <br/>
making lightning like the discus that shines in the hands of Padmanabhan, <br/>
roaring  with thunder like the sound of his conch, <br/>
and  pouring  rain like the arrows from his Sarngam bow.<br/>
O Varuṇa, give us rain so that the people of the world may live happily.<br/>
Come and let us bathe joyfully in this month of Markazhi<br/>
and go to worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
478. The girls  come to wake up their friends. They say, <br/>
“He, the bright light of cowherd clan, <br/>
Damodaran who made his mother's womb divine, <br/>
the young Māyan, the king of northern Mathura, <br/>
grew up playing on the banks of the Jamuna river<br/>
whose water is abundant and pure.<br/>
Faultless, we come, sprinkle flowers, worship him, <br/>
sing his praises and think only of him in our minds.<br/>
All the bad things we have done and may do<br/>
will disappear like dust in fire. <br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.” <br/>
<br/>
479. The girls  come to wake up their friends. They say, <br/>
“See, the birds are singing. <br/>
Do you hear the loud calling of the white conch <br/>
in the temple of the god of Garuḍa?<br/>
O friend, get up. <br/>
He, the seed of the world <br/>
who drank the poison from Putanā's breasts<br/>
and destroyed the cheating Sakaṭāsuran, <br/>
rests on the ocean on the snake Adishesha. <br/>
Sages and yogis rise and praise him saying, “Hari, Hari!”<br/>
Listen to their praise and get up, happy in your heart.<br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
480. The girls  come to wake up their friends . They say, <br/>
“O crazy one, don't you hear the sound of the sparrows flocking together <br/>
and calling “keech, keech” everywhere?<br/>
The cowherd women with fragrant hair and many ornaments <br/>
are churning the yogurt. Don't you hear their sound?<br/>
You are a queen of the cowherd village.<br/>
How can you sleep when you hear people <br/>
singing the praise of Kesavan? <br/>
You shine brightly! Open the door. <br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
481. The girls  come to wake up their friend. They  say, <br/>
“The east is growing bright<br/>
and the buffaloes leave their small sheds and go to graze. <br/>
Women are about to do their nombu,<br/>
but we have stopped them so they will wait for you <br/>
and we have come to wake you up.<br/>
Get up, cheerful one!<br/>
If we sing his praise wishing to get the Paṛai<br/>
and worship the god of gods who split open the mouth<br/>
of the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse<br/>
and fought with the wrestlers and defeated them, <br/>
he will give us his grace. <br/>
That would be a wonderful thing.<br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
482. The girls come to wake up their friends. They  say, <br/>
“O my uncle’s daughter, it is morning<br/>
and still you are sleeping on your bed in your room  <br/>
where the fragrance of incense spreads everywhere <br/>
and the lamps on all sides of the palace <br/>
studded with pure jewels shine. <br/>
Open your beautiful door. <br/>
O aunts, won't you wake her up? <br/>
Doesn't your daughter speak? Doesn't she hear?<br/>
Has some magic put her into deep sleep?<br/>
Let us praise the god singing his many names, <br/>
saying ‘You are the Māyan, Madhavan, Vaikuṇṭan!’<br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
483. The girls come to wake up their friends. They  say,<br/>
“You want to find happiness doing your nombu<br/>
but you don’t open the door and don’t answer us.<br/>
The virtuous Nārāyaṇan, adorned with a thulasi garland, <br/>
will give us the Paṛai. <br/>
Does Kumbakarṇan who fell into the mouth of Yama in battle <br/>
make you sleep so soundly?<br/>
You are very lazy! You are a precious ornament!<br/>
Wake up and open the door.<br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
484. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say, <br/>
“You are as beautiful as a golden vine, <br/>
the daughter of the faultless cowherds, owners of many cows, <br/>
who fight their enemies bravely and destroy their valor. <br/>
You  are as beautiful as a forest peacock, get up.<br/>
Your friends in the neighborhood have come <br/>
and stand in your front yard <br/>
and praise the fame of the dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan<br/>
but you have not stirred from your bed. <br/>
O dear girl, you have not said a word. <br/>
Why are you sleeping like this?<br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.” <br/>
<br/>
485. The girls come to wake up their friends. They  say,  <br/>
“You come from a rich family. <br/>
The buffaloes that just gave birth<br/>
drip milk from their udders lovingly, thinking of their calves,<br/>
and the front yard of the house is wet with their milk. <br/>
We sing praising the names of the sweet god<br/>
who angrily destroyed the king of southern Lanka<br/>
but you haven’t opened your mouth.<br/>
Wake up. Why do you sleep like this?<br/>
Don't you know all the people in your house are up? <br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
486. The girls come to wake up their friends. They  say, <br/>
All other girls, singing and praising the fame of him <br/>
who killed the evil Rakshasa Ravaṇa,<br/>
and split open the mouth of the Asuran<br/>
when he came as a bird<br/>
have gone to worship the Pāvai. <br/>
The star Guru fades and the Sukran rises.<br/>
See, the birds are awake and chatter.<br/>
Why are you with eyes like blossoms<br/>
sleeping without coming with us<br/>
to bathe and play in the cool water?<br/>
Today is an auspicious day. <br/>
Don’t pretend to sleep.<br/>
Come and join us.<br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
487. The girls come to wake up their friends. They  say, <br/>
“See, in your backyard, in the pond in your garden, <br/>
senkazhuneer flowers open and ambal flowers close.<br/>
Sages, doing pure tapas and wearing clothes<br/>
that are red like powdered brick<br/>
go to the divine temple to blow their conches. <br/>
O young girl, you said you would wake us up.<br/>
Aren't you ashamed? Get up. <br/>
You don’t do the things that you say you will. <br/>
Come, let us sing and praise the lotus-eyed god <br/>
with a conch and discus in his strong hands.<br/>
Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
488. The girls come to wake up their friends. They  say, <br/>
“You are as beautiful as a young parrot.<br/>
What is this? You’re still asleep—wake up.!”<br/>
She answers, “Don’t shout and wake me up. <br/>
I am a poor girl and you are as bright as lightning. I’m coming.”<br/>
They say, “We know your tricks. You always say this.”<br/>
She answers, “You are the clever ones. <br/>
Let me be what I am.”<br/>
They say, “Come quickly. We can’t wait for you.”<br/>
She asks, “Have all our friends arrived?”<br/>
They say, “Yes, They’re all here. <br/>
If you want, come and count them.<br/>

“You are the guard of the palace of the lord Nandagopan<br/>
who protect the doors that are decorated with flags and festoons.<br/>
The dark jewel-colored Māyavan <br/>
said yesterday that he would give  <br/>
a sounding Paṛai to us, the cowherd girls. <br/>
We have bathed to make ourselves pure<br/>
and have come to sing and wake him up. <br/>
O guard! Don’t say this or that and make excuses. <br/>

who give clothes, water and food to all, get up!<br/>
O Yashoda, tender shoot among all the women who are soft as vines,<br/>
the bright light of your family, and our dear one, get up.<br/>
O king of the gods with feet adorned with pure golden anklets. <br/>
You grew tall, split the sky and measured the world.<br/>

We are going to worship our Pāvai<br/>

“O, fragrant-haired Nappinnai,<br/>
daughter-in-law of strong-armed Nandagopan,<br/>
who own of many rutting elephants, open the door.<br/>
The roosters are calling to wake everyone<br/>

open the door so the lovely bracelets<br/>

and the room is bright with lights.<br/>
O Nappinnai with kohl-darkened eyes, open your mouth, <br/>
How could you not get up and want to see your beloved?<br/>
Surely you can understand<br/>
that you won’t be able to be away from him for long.<br/>
This isn’t good for you. <br/>
We are going to worship our Pāvai<br/>
<br/>
493. The girls coming to wake up the lord and Nappinnai say, <br/>

as if we were queens of this wide world,<br/>
and we stay by your bed and worship you.<br/>

bright as the sun and the moon,<br/>
show us even a little grace?<br/>
If you look at us, our karma will go away.<br/>
We are going to worship our Pāvai<br/>
<br/>
496. The girls coming to wake up the god say, <br/>
“As you, colored as dark as a kāyam flower, wake up<br/>
you are like a lion that has slept <br/>
in a mountain cave in the rainy season, <br/>
that opens its fiery eyes and roars, its mane hanging low. <br/>
You come from your temple and sit on your majestic throne.<br/>
Give us your grace, and help us.<br/>

at Kabithasuran who had taken the form of a vilam tree<br/>
and killed them both.<br/>
We worship your ankleted feet.<br/>
You carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows. <br/>

<br/>
498. The girls ask for the Paṛai saying, <br/>
“In the night you were born to Devaki<br/>
and were raised by Yashoda.<br/>
This is something no one knows.<br/>
You were like a burning fire in Kamsan’s stomach<br/>
because he always thought of giving you trouble. <br/>
Kamsan always wanted to hurt you <br/>
but you fought with him and killed him. <br/>
O Neḍumāl! We worship you and have come here to you.<br/>
If you give us the Paṛai, <br/>

We want to have white milk-colored conches<br/>
that will roar and shake the earth like your conch, the pancajanyam. <br/>
We want many good Paṛais.<br/>
We want to be with people singing “Pallaṇḍu!”to you.<br/>
You as  a beautiful baby slept on the banyan leaf.<br/>

we wish to receive a Paṛai from you and praise you. <br/>
We want many gifts—bracelets, earrings, earrings, anklets<br/>
and other ornaments that everyone desires<br/>
and we will be happy to wear them. <br/>
Wearing beautiful clothes, <br/>

and as we eat the ghee will drip from our elbows.<br/>
We are going to worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
501. The girls, asking for a Paṛai from the god, say, <br/>

to eat our food there. <br/>
You were raised with simple cowherd people. <br/>
We are fortunate to be born in the same place as you<br/>
O faultless Govindan, we cannot give up our closeness to you. <br/>
We, innocent children,<br/>
call you with simple names because we love you.<br/>

We are going to worship our Pāvai.”<br/>
<br/>
502. The cowherd girls say, <br/>

We want to serve you and receive the Paṛai from you.<br/>
See, Govindan, we want to be with you always <br/>
and we will serve you in all our fourteen births.<br/>
Give us your grace <br/>

with lovely moon-like faces,<br/>
decorated with beautiful ornaments,<br/>

and asked for the Paṛai. <br/>
If devotees recite these pāsurams without mistakes<br/>
they will receive the grace of rich Thirumal, <br/>
with a lovely face, beautiful eyes <br/>
and twelve strong mountain-like arms<br/>
and be happy.<br/>

3.  Aṇḍal.:    Nāchiyār Thirumozhi  (504-646)</h3></center>
<strong>
The cowherd women worship  Kāma, the god of love.<br/>
</strong><br/>
504. We clean the floor in the month of Thai <br/>
and decorate it with beautiful kolams.<br/>
In the month of Masi we use soft white powder<br/>
and make lovely decorations in our front yard.<br/>
O Kamadeva, I worship you and your brother Saman.<br/>
I wonder, can I survive this love sickness?<br/>
Give me the boon of belonging to the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam<br/>
holding a discus in his hand that throws out fire. <br/>
<br/>
505. We decorate our front yard with soft white sand.<br/>
We bathe at dawn when the sun comes out<br/>
and make fire with sticks that have no thorns.<br/>
I make all efforts to worship you, O Kamadeva<br/>
with your flower arrows that drip honey.<br/>
I write the name of the ocean-colored one in my mind.<br/>
Give me your grace so I may enter the place of him<br/>
who split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird.<br/>
<br/>
506. I worship your feet all three times of the day <br/>
placing fragrant umatham flowers and blossoms of murukkam on them.<br/>
O Manmatha, I don’t want to be angry with you<br/>
and scold you, saying that you are heartless.<br/>
Get ready with your fresh flower arrows <br/>
and give me your grace <br/>
so I may enter into the brightness<br/>
of the clever lord of Venkaṭam hills. <br/>
<br/>
507. O Kamadeva, god without a body,<br/>
I wrote your name on the wall,<br/>
and I made a fish flag and gave it to you<br/>
with horses, fans and a sugarcane-bow.<br/>
I worshipped you and asked you to give me your grace<br/>
so that my round breasts<br/>
would belong at once to the lord of Dwarapuri.<br/>
<br/>
508. If people wish to give me away in marriage<br/>
so that my round breasts belong to someone human<br/>
instead of the pure lord with a conch and discus, <br/>
it would be as if foxes that wander in the forest<br/>
came and ate the food that the sages make in a sacrifice <br/>
for the gods in the sky. O Manmatha,<br/>
I will not live if I have to marry someone other than my lord. <br/>
<br/>
509. I am doing nombu on the streets where you will be going<br/>
with beautiful young girls who know the sastras, O Kamadeva.<br/>
He has the dark color of the clouds and the kāyām flower<br/>
and shines like a karuvilai blossom.<br/>
Give me your grace<br/>
so that the lotus-faced lord will see me with his divine eyes <br/>
and give me his grace.START<br/>
<br/>
510. I offer paddy, sugarcane,<br/>
cooked rice with brown sugar and aval <br/>
and worship you reciting the manthras from the sastras.<br/>
O Manmatha, I bow to you.<br/>
Give me your grace so that Thirivikraman<br/>
who measured the world <br/>
will touch me with his divine hands.<br/>
Give me your grace so that he will approach me<br/>
and touch my breasts.<br/>
<br/>
511. I don’t bathe when it is time for my nombu.<br/>
I don’t comb my hair. I eat once a day <br/>
and my mouth grows pale because I haven’t eaten enough.<br/>
You can see how I suffer for this nombu.<br/>
I want tell you something:<br/>
Kesavan Nambi fought with the Asuran Kesi to protect a woman. <br/>
Give me your grace so that he will show me the same compassion <br/>
and I will have the fortune of sitting with him and pressing his feet. <br/>
<br/>
512. I sprinkle flowers and worship you <br/>
and bow to your feet three times a day.<br/>
If I am unable to live for the dark ocean-colored lord <br/>
and to serve him faultlessly,<br/>
I will cry and suffer and you, Kamadeva, will feel bad.<br/>
It will be as if you didn’t feed an ox that plows <br/>
and hit it with a stick instead. <br/>
<br/>
513. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of Puduvai <br/>
where the mountain-like palaces shine <br/>
composed pāsurams about the women<br/>
who worshiped Kama,<br/>
with a sugarcane bow and flower arrows.<br/>
and how they wanted his grace<br/>
so that they might be with the god<br/>
who broke the tusks of the elephant<br/>
and split open the beak of the bird.<br/>

<strong>Women asks Kaṇṇan not to destroys their sand houses.<br/>
</strong><br/>
514. O Nārāyaṇā praised with a thousand names,<br/>
if Yashoda had given birth to you,<br/>
it would be easy for us to love you<br/>
because you would be human just like we are.<br/>
We do nombu in the month of Punguni <br/>
because that is the month when Kama comes.<br/>
O Sridhara, don’t bother us, <br/>
don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
515. We worked all day to build these sand houses and our backs hurt. <br/>
Look at our sand houses. They make us happy.<br/>
O ancient one who slept on a banyan leaf as a baby,<br/>
it is a pity that you are not kind to us. <br/>
Do not come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
516. You who sleep on the deep ocean <br/>
took the form of a lion to destroy Hiraṇyan<br/>
and saved Gajendra from the mouth of the crocodile. <br/>
When we saw you and fell in love with you, <br/>
you looked at us out of the corner of your eye<br/>
and didn’t worry about what we might think.<br/>
We worked hard to make our houses with soft sand <br/>
and our bangled hands hurt.<br/>
O lord, you rest on the ocean where clear waves roll.<br/>
Do not come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
517. O lord, you have the color of the rain-giving clouds<br/>
and your speech and deeds fascinate us.<br/>
What spell does your beautiful face cast to bewitch us?<br/>
We won’t complain to others <br/>
that you trouble us innocent, weak girls.<br/>
We don’t want them to blame you<br/>
with your lovely lotus eyes.<br/>
Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
518. We made our sand houses with soft white sand<br/>
and everyone on the street was amazed<br/>
when they saw our lovely sand houses<br/>
but you came and destroyed them. <br/>
Even so we aren’t angry at you.<br/>
Our hearts melt for your love.<br/>
You are a thief, Madhavan, Kesavan.<br/>
Don't you have eyes on your face?<br/>
Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
519. We are children, not grown-up yet,<br/>
and our breasts haven’t grown out.<br/>
You come here to knock over our little sand houses<br/>
but really wanting to do something else.<br/>
We don’t understand what you want.<br/>
You who built a bridge on the ocean, went to Lanka,<br/>
and fought and destroyed the Raksasa clan<br/>
are the servant of all of your devotees.<br/>
Don’t give us trouble,<br/>
don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
520. If you talk to people who understand what you say,<br/>
that will be all right,<br/>
but if you talk to us who are young and don’t know anything,<br/>
it just hurts us. What do you gain from that?<br/>
You who have the color of the wide sounding ocean<br/>
and built the bridge Sethu<br/>
will get in trouble with your wives.<br/>
Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
521. We brought a pot, a winnowing fan and sand,<br/>
built sand houses and are playing as we like. <br/>
What is the use of destroying our sand houses?<br/>
What do you get if you come <br/>
and kick them down and give us trouble?<br/>
Ocean-colored wone with a shining discus in your hand,<br/>
don’t you know that even jaggery will not be sweet <br/>
if your mind is bitter?<br/>
Don’t come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
522. O Govinda, you enter our yard and, smiling,<br/>
not only destroy do you our little sand houses,<br/>
you destroy our hearts as well. <br/>
You measured the earth <br/>
and grew tall and measured the sky.<br/>
What will those standing near us say<br/>
if you come and embrace us? <br/>
Do not come and destroy our little sand houses.<br/>
<br/>
523. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of Villiputhur<br/>
where Vediyar recite the Vedas<br/>
composed pāsurams about what the cowherd girls <br/>
playing and making little sand houses said to Kaṇṇan.<br/>
They said, “You who drank the nectar of the mouth of Sita,<br/>
do not destroy our little sand houses.”<br/>
If devotees learn these pāsurams well <br/>
they will go to Vaikuṇṭam. <br/>

<strong>Cowherd girls asking Kaṇṇan to give their clothes. <br/>
</strong><br/>
524. We got up in the morning before the rooster crowed <br/>
and came to bathe, plunging into the water.<br/>
Our beloved sun god rises coming on his chariot.<br/>
You who rest on a snake bed give us trouble. <br/>
We won’t come to the pond from now on.<br/>
I and my friends worship you. Give us our clothes.<br/>
<br/>
525. Why did you come here,<br/>
dear one, how did you come to this pond?<br/>
You, the Māyan, as sweet as nectar,<br/>
are adorned with a thulasi garland dripping with honey.<br/>
O, clever one! We will not leave you even it is our fate. <br/>
Don’t go away here and there. <br/>
Don’t take our clothes like this.<br/>
You who danced on the snake Kalingan,<br/>
give us back the clothes you put on the kurundam tree.<br/>
<br/>
526. It is early morning. <br/>
What is this childishness?<br/>
If my relatives see this, they won’t like it,<br/>
but you don’t think what you do is naughty.<br/>
You sit on the kurundam tree and we can’t reach you.<br/>
We will give you whatever you want.<br/>
Give us back our clothes. <br/>
We will go away and no one will see your mischief.<br/>
O god you destroyed Lanka with your bow, <br/>
<br/>
527. We plunge into the pond and bathe. <br/>
We look everywhere <br/>
and make sure no one is looking.<br/>
Our eyes don’t want to stop shedding tears<br/>
because we don’t have our clothes.<br/>
You don’t have any pity on us.<br/>
O lord who destroyed Lanka,<br/>
we know that you were the king of the monkeys.<br/>
Give us back the clothes<br/>
you put on the kurundam tree.<br/>
<br/>
528. My brothers with spears will come running <br/>
even if they hear that valai and kayal fish<br/>
are biting our feet in the pond.<br/>
It is not a joke.<br/>
O lord with a beautiful dark-colored body,<br/>
don’t stay on the kurundam tree with our beautiful clothes. <br/>
Give us back our silk clothes. <br/>
<br/>
529. The stalks of the lotus plants <br/>
that bloom in the pond hurt our feet<br/>
and it feels as if scorpions were biting us.<br/>
We can’t bear the pain.<br/>
We can’t stay in the water for a long time.<br/>
You, the king, can throw pots in the sky <br/>
and dance the kuthu dance. <br/>
Don’t be mischievous. <br/>
Give us back our silk clothes.<br/>
<br/>
530. We are sitting in the water, tired<br/>
while you are doing things you shouldn’t. <br/>
Our houses are far away. <br/>
You are the god who knows <br/>
what will happen when the world ends.<br/>
We really love you.<br/>
If our mothers see us, they won’t like it.<br/>
Drop our silk clothes down to us. <br/>
Don’t sit in the top of the kurundam tree <br/>
blooming with flowers. <br/>
<br/>
531. All the women, the mothers-in-law <br/>
and others are here bathing. <br/>
We couldn’t close our beautiful flower-like eyes in the night<br/>
thinking of your naughty acts. <br/>
This isn’t good for us. <br/>
We are telling you about all the troubles you cause.<br/>
You are the beautiful jewel-like son of the cowherd village.<br/>
Give us the clothes back <br/>
that you put on the kurundam tree. <br/>
<br/>
532. You escaped from the trap of Kamsan<br/>
and survived in the dark night when you were born.<br/>
Is it because you wanted to bother us like this?<br/>
Yashoda loves you so much <br/>
that she doesn’t scold you even if you are naughty.<br/>
She just leaves you to do whatever you want. <br/>
You weren’t ashamed to drink the milk <br/>
of the wicked Rakshasi Putanā.<br/>
Give us back our clothes. <br/>
<br/>
533. Vishṇuchithan Kodai the chief of Puduvai <br/>
surrounded by golden palaces<br/>
composed with beautiful music <br/>

If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will go to Vaikuṇṭam <br/>
and be with the eternal god Mādhavan. <br/>

in punnai, kurukkathi, nyāzhal and cherundi trees,<br/>
won’t you coo and call at all times of the day <br/>
for the one with a coral-colored mouth to come quickly to me?<br/>
<br/>
546. The faultless one who carries <br/>
a sounding white conch in his left hand<br/>
does not show his form to me.<br/>
He entered my heart and makes me long for his love.<br/>
See, he is taking my life away and playing with my feelings.<br/>
O cuckoo bird, you drink the honey that drips <br/>
from the blooming shenbaga flowers and sing happily. <br/>
Don’t be lazy and prattle, just sing and be happy. <br/>
Coo and call so the lord of Venkaṭam hill will come to me. <br/>
<br/>
547. As Rāma he fought with Ravaṇan <br/>
while the charioteer Madali drove his chariot,<br/>
and he cut off all the ten heads of Ravaṇan,<br/>
shooting his arrows like rain.<br/>
I don’t see him coming to me.<br/>
O cuckoo bird, you live with your beloved mate <br/>
listening to the kāmaram music of the bees <br/>
that have dots on their bodies<br/>
in the groves where fragrant flowers bloom <br/>
and spread their smell. <br/>
Coo and call the dark-colored one <br/>
shining like a diamond so he will come to me.<br/>
<br/>
548. My bones melt,<br/>
my long spear-like eyes do not close.<br/>
I have entered an ocean of sorrow <br/>
and cannot find the boat that is the Vaikundan<br/>
to escape my suffering. <br/>
O cuckoo bird,<br/>
you know how hard it is to be apart from your beloved. <br/>
Coo and call the virtuous one with a golden body and an eagle flag<br/>
and make him come to me.<br/>
<br/>
549. He stays in Villiputhur <br/>
where the swans that walk softly play.<br/>
My fish-like eyes do not close to sleep <br/>
because they wish to see his golden feet.<br/>
O cuckoo bird, I will make the beautiful parrot <br/>
that I raised feeding it sweet rice and milk be your friend.<br/>
Coo and call him, so that who  measured the world will come to me.<br/>
<br/>
550. Rishikesan, worshiped by the gods in all the directions,<br/>
made me unhappy with love for him<br/>
and the beauty of the white pearl-like smile of my red mouth<br/>
and of my breasts was lost. <br/>
O young cuckoo bird,<br/>
you sleep in a beautiful place <br/>
in a grove blooming with flowers.<br/>
If you coo and call for him, the true one, to come to me, <br/>
I will bow my head to you.<br/>
I don’t know any other way to pay you back. <br/>
<br/>
551. He rests on the surging milky ocean. <br/>
My breasts have grown out and are happy <br/>
because they want to embrace the lord,<br/>
but they make me sad since I have not seen him.<br/>
O beautiful cuckoo bird, why are you hiding?<br/>
If you coo and call and make him <br/>
with a discus, a conch and a strong club come to me, <br/>
you will have the good karma of doing many generous acts.<br/>
<br/>
552. The clever one who is loved by all, <br/>
shoots arrows from his bow with his strong hands. <br/>
He and I know the promises that we made when we stayed in our home.<br/>
O small cuckoo bird who pluck the tender shoots<br/>
of the sweet mango tree in the grove,<br/>
if you coo and call for Thirumāl to come here quickly,<br/>
you will see what I will do for him with my love. <br/>
<br/>
553. I have fallen in love with Sridharan<br/>
who has the color of a green parrot. <br/>
O cuckoo bird living in a grove that swarms with shining bees,<br/>
give me your attention and listen.<br/>
Either you should coo and call,<br/>
asking him with a conch and discus to come to me,<br/>
or you should find the golden bangles <br/>
that I have lost and bring them to me. <br/>
If you want to live in this grove, <br/>
you should do one of these things.<br/>
<br/>
554. I fell in love with him <br/>
who measured the world and became his devotee,<br/>
but he only makes me sad<br/>
because I love him and have not seen him.<br/>
I can’t describe the sorrow <br/>
that the breeze and the moon give me.<br/>
O cuckoo bird, don’t make me suffer<br/>
staying in this grove and cooing always.<br/>
If you don’t call today for Narayaṇan to come,<br/>
I will chase you away from here. <br/>
<br/>
555. The Paṭṭarpirān Kodai, chief of Puduvai <br/>
where Vediyar recite with music the four Vedas<br/>
composed ten pāsurams about how a woman <br/>
with spear-like eyes asked a cuckoo bird <br/>
to call for him who grew into the sky<br/>
and measured the world to come, saying, <br/>
“O dark cuckoo bird, coo and call my ocean-colored beloved.”<br/>
If devotees learn these pāsurams and recite them and say, <br/>
“Namo, Narayaṇā!” they will reach him.<br/>

<strong>Her dream of the Wedding. <br/>
</strong><br/>
556. O friend, I had a dream. <br/>
People decorated every place with festoons <br/>
and put out golden pots with coconuts <br/>
to welcome Nāraṇan Nambi <br/>
when he comes in procession<br/>
surrounded by a thousand elephants.<br/>
<br/>
557. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
My relatives decided the day for my wedding. <br/>
They decorated a beautiful pandal with kamugu trees. <br/>
Mādhavan Govindan who once took a form of a lion,<br/>
strong as a bull, entered into the pandal— <br/>
I saw him in my dream.<br/>
<br/>
558. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
Indra and the other gods came together, <br/>
asked for me to be his bride <br/>
and made all the arrangements. <br/>
My sister-in-law Durgā  tied a silk marriage sari on me<br/>
and decorated me with fragrant garlands. <br/>
<br/>
559. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
The Brahmin brought divine water <br/>
from different directions and sprinkled it all over. <br/>
They sang songs of purification.<br/>
The priest tied the string bound together with flowers <br/>
on my hand and on the divine groom’s hand to protect us. <br/>
<br/>
560. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
Dancing women carried shining lights and kalasams <br/>
and went in front of him and welcomed him. <br/>
The king of Madura walked touching the earth <br/>
as the earth shook. <br/>
<br/>
561. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
The drums were beaten, the lined conches were blown<br/>
and my bridegroom, Nambi Madhusūdanan,<br/>
came and held my hand <br/>
under the pandal that was decorated <br/>
with hanging strings of pearl garlands. <br/>
<br/>
562. Skilled Vediyars recited the Vedas, <br/>
and chanted  mantras.<br/>
They made a likeness of the sun <br/>
with green naṇal grass.<br/>
He is strong as an angry elephant <br/>
and he held my hand and we circled the fire.<br/>
<br/>
563. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
He  is the refuge for this birth <br/>
and the fourteen future births.<br/>
He, our king Narayaṇan Nambi held my feet<br/>
with his divine, perfect fingers <br/>
and placed them on the grinding stone. <br/>
<br/>
564. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
My brothers with shining faces and bows<br/>
came and, standing before us,<br/>
kindled the fire and made it bright.<br/>
They joined my hand with the hand of Achuthan<br/>
who once took the form of a lion,<br/>
and they poured popped rice on it. <br/>
<br/>
565. O friend, I had a dream.<br/>
Adorned with kumkum <br/>
and smeared with cool sandal paste,<br/>
I went with him on an elephant in procession<br/>
circling all the auspicious streets <br/>
as people sprinkled turmeric water on us.<br/>
<br/>
566. The chief of Villipputhur Kodai,<br/>
praised by the family of Veyars, <br/>
composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams<br/>
that describe the dream of a woman <br/>
and what she said about her marriage with the cowherd.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams <br/>
they will give birth to many good children and find happiness. <br/>
--------------<br/><br/>
<strong>Praising the conch <br/>
</strong><br/>
567. O white conch, born in the ocean,<br/>
tell me—I ask you anxiously. <br/>
He puts you in his mouth to make the sound of victory.<br/>
What is the taste and the fragrance <br/>
of the mouth of Mādhavan<br/>
who broke the tusks of the elephant?<br/>
Does it have the fragrance of camphor?<br/>
Does it have the fragrance of a lotus flower?<br/>
Does his beautiful red coral mouth taste sweet?<br/>
<br/>
568. O beautiful conch born in the ocean,  <br/>
you entered the body of the Asuran Panchajanya<br/>
and now you rest in his hand,<br/>
making the sound of victory<br/>
when he conquers the evil Asurans. <br/>
<br/>
569. You are a wonderful conch!<br/>
Like the full moon that rises in the autumn<br/>
from behind the large mountain, <br/>
you stay in the hands of Vasudevan<br/>
the king of northern Madura. <br/>
<br/>
570. O beautiful large valampuri conch,<br/>
you are like the moon even though you are not in the sky.<br/>
As you stay in the hand of  Damodaran,<br/>
do you say any mantras in his ears?<br/>
Even Indra the king of gods<br/>
does not have the fortune that you have. <br/>
<br/>
571. O Panchajanya!<br/>
Others were born along with you in the ocean,<br/>
but they do not receive the respect that you do.<br/>
You drink constantly the nectar from the mouth <br/>
of the king Madhusūdanan. <br/>
<br/>
572. O Valampuri conch,<br/>
you have not gone to the Ganges<br/>
or on other pilgrimages to bathe,<br/>
yet you rest in the hands of lovely-eyed Thirumāl<br/>
who destroyed the Asurans <br/>
when they came as marudam trees. <br/>
You have the good fortune of plunging <br/>
into the divine water that comes from his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
573. O king of conches,<br/>
like a swan that stays on a fresh red lotus flower and drinks honey, <br/>
you are held in the beautiful hands of Vasudevan<br/>
with a dark body and red eyes and you stay with him.<br/>
Your good fortune is truly wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
574. O Panchajanya, your food is the nectar <br/>
that springs from the mouth of him <br/>
who measured the world<br/>
and you sleep in the hands of the ocean-colored god.<br/>
You make women jealous<br/>
and they complain loudly about your good luck,<br/>
<br/>
575. O fortunate conch<br/>
who drink nectar from the mouth of Madhavan <br/>
as if you were drinking honey,<br/>
won’t his sixteen thousand wives be angry<br/>
when they see you with him<br/>
drinking the nectar that all others want to drink?<br/>
<br/>
576. Paṭṭarpirān Kodai, famed in rich Puduvai,<br/>
composed ten Tamil pāsurams <br/>
describing Padmanābhan with the Panchajanya conch.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will be near him..<br/>
--------------<br/><br/>
<strong>The cloud messenger<br/>
</strong><br/>
577. O clouds, you look like a blue blanket covering the sky. <br/>
Thirumāl, of Venkaṭam hill where clear water flows <br/>
has not come to see me<br/>
and the tears from my eyes fall on my breasts. <br/>
I am tired and I am only a woman.<br/>
Is it right that he should destroy my pride like this? <br/>
<br/>
578. O dark clouds pouring your rain like rich pearls,<br/>
do you have any message from the god of Venkaṭam,<br/>
the generous one colored as dark as night?<br/>
My love for him burns me like fire.<br/>
If in the middle of the night<br/>
the breeze comes and hurts me, <br/>
how will I survive?<br/>
<br/>
579. O clouds, you are generous <br/>
and give rain to the earth.<br/>
My shining beauty, bangles, mind and sleep <br/>
have all gone, taking my pride with them.<br/>
I survive only by singing the divine qualities of Govindan,<br/>
the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam where cool waterfalls flow.<br/>
<br/>
580. O shining clouds with lightning,<br/>
he is the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam <br/>
with the goddess Lakshmi on his handsome chest.<br/>
Can you tell him that my breasts desire<br/>
every day to embrace his golden chest? <br/>
<br/>
581. O dark clouds, rising in the sky and spreading everywhere,<br/>
you pour rain in Thiruvenkaṭam<br/>
and make the flowers bloom and drip honey.<br/>
If you would go to him to bring back my bangles<br/>
that he has taken away,<br/>
tell him who split open the body of Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws,<br/>
how much I love him and suffer.<br/>
<br/>
582. O cool clouds,<br/>
you take water from the ocean,<br/>
rise to the sky and pour rain everywhere<br/>
in Thiruvenkaṭam of Thirumāl <br/>
who took the land from Mahābali.<br/>
Like insects that enter into a vilam fruit and eat it,<br/>
Nāraṇan has entered into my heart and made me suffer. <br/>
Go and tell him how much I love him.<br/>
<br/>
583. O cool clouds floating on the hills of Thiruvenkaṭam <br/>
of the lovely-eyed Thirumāl<br/>
who churned the milky ocean filled with conches,<br/>
I bow to his feet and ask him for one thing.<br/>
Only if he comes one day and embraces me<br/>
smearing kumkum paste on my breasts <br/>
will I be able to survive. <br/>
Go tell him this. <br/>
<br/>
584. O clouds that rise in the rainy season <br/>
in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,<br/>
I fall down like the old leaves of the erukkam plants <br/>
when raindrops fall on them<br/>
and recite the names of him <br/>
who went to the battlefield and fought for the Pāndavas.<br/>
Will he come one day and talk to me?<br/>
<br/>
585. O huge clouds rising like rutting elephants,<br/>
you think Thiruvenkaṭam is your place and live there. <br/>
What does he, resting on the snake bed, wish to tell me?<br/>
The people of the world may say, <br/>
“He doesn’t understand that she thinks that he is her refuge<br/>
and he hurts her, as beautiful as a vine.” <br/>
<br/>
586. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of flourishing Puduvai, <br/>
composed ten Tamil pāsurams <br/>
about how a girl with a beautiful forehead<br/>
asks the clouds to go as messengers <br/>
and tell how she suffers from love <br/>
for him who rests on the snake bed. <br/>
If devotees learn these pāsurams and keep them in their minds <br/>
they will become his devotees. <br/>
--------------<br/><br/>
<strong>The love of a girl for the lord <br/>
</strong><br/>
587. O velvet mites colored like red sinduram powder,<br/>
and flying everywhere in the groves of Thirumālirunjolai,<br/>
I am caught in my love for the one with handsome arms<br/>
who churned the milky ocean with Mandara mountain <br/>
and took its sweet nectar.<br/>
It is like a net. Will I survive this sorrow?<br/>
<br/>
588. O friend, the mullai flowers on the vines in the forest<br/>
filled with blossoms laugh at me in Thirumālirunjolai<br/>
where elephants fight with each other and play.<br/>
The vines that grow in the rainy season <br/>
bloom as if to say, “You will not survive!”<br/>
To whom can I tell the pain that his garland gives me?<br/>
<br/>
589. O beautiful karuvilai flowers! Kāyām flowers!<br/>
You have the color of the lord<br/>
Tell me how I can survive. <br/>
Is it right that strong-armed Nambi of Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
who is always playing <br/>
should come into our house and steal my bangles?<br/>
<br/>
590. O cuckoo birds in the flourishing groves!<br/>
Peacocks! Beautiful karuvilai blossoms!<br/>
Fresh kala fruits! Colorful fragrant kāyām flowers!<br/>
You are my five most powerful enemies.<br/>
Why must you have the color of the dear lord<br/>
of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai?<br/>
Is it to make me sad with love and hurt me?<br/>
<br/>
591. O swarm of bees, <br/>
you have the divine color of the dark cloud-colored lord <br/>
with beautiful eyes <br/>
who stays in Thirumālirunjolai<br/>
surrounded with flourishing flowers.<br/>
O abundant, beautiful mountain springs!<br/>
O lovely lotus flowers! <br/>
Tell me, who can be my refuge?<br/>
<br/>
592. I made a hundred pots of butter <br/>
for Nambi of Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
surrounded with fragrant groves. <br/>
I told him I will fill all the hundred pots <br/>
with sweet pongal for him. <br/>
He grows more and more beautiful.<br/>
Do you think he will come and eat?<br/>
<br/>
593. If the dear lord of Thirumālirunjolai <br/>
where a fragrant breeze blows <br/>
enters my heart and stays there, <br/>
I will make a hundred thousand pots of butter <br/>
and sweet pongal and give them to him.<br/>
If he comes today and eats, <br/>
I will give him all these pots and serve him. <br/>
<br/>
594. A flock of black sparrows wakes up in the morning,<br/>
welcomes Thirumāl and sings the raga maruḷ. <br/>
Is it true that they sing that raga to wake him up?<br/>
They sing as if they were repeating the names of <br/>
him who stays in Thirumālirunjolai, <br/>
the lord of Dwarapathi who sleeps on a banyan leaf,<br/>
but he does not come to me.<br/>
<br/>
595. I seem to hang down like the golden flowers <br/>
that sway on the branches of kondrai trees <br/>
in Thirumālirunjolai surrounded by groves<br/>
where kongu flowers bloom. <br/>
When will I hear the sound of the conch<br/>
that he blows with his lotus mouth, <br/>
and the sound of his Sarngam bow that shoots arrows?<br/>
<br/>
596. Vishṇuchithan the chief of Villiputhur<br/>
with a garland swarming with bees<br/>
composed ten lovely Tamil pāsurams<br/>
praising the beautiful lord of Thirumālirunjolai<br/>
where the Silampāṛu river flows<br/>
bringing sandalwood, akil wood <br/>
and throwing them up on its banks.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these ten lovely pāsurams <br/>
they will join the feet of Thirumāl. <br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>Flowers blooming in the rainy season<br/>
</strong><br/>
597. O flowers that bloom in the monsoon,<br/>
did the dark ocean-colored god<br/>
send you as warriors to fight with me?<br/>
Where did he go? To whom can I complain?<br/>
I cannot fight with my heart <br/>
that wants his beautiful thulasi garland.<br/>
<br/>
598. O thondri flowers blooming high, <br/>
do not grow to the sky <br/>
and burn me like the brightness of the discus <br/>
that is in the hand of him, the ancient god<br/>
praised by the Vedas.<br/>
Take me to the group of the cowherds where he is.<br/>
<br/>
599. O kovai vine, you are like my mother!<br/>
Don’t take my life, ripening with your sweet round fruits<br/>
that remind me of his dark color. <br/>
I am afraid of your lovely red color. <br/>
Pitiful, I say two things that are opposite.<br/>
I say I will not live without him,<br/>
yet I am alive without him now <br/>
and say that I want to be with him. <br/>
I am shameless like two-tongued Adisesha <br/>
on whom the lord rests.<br/>
<br/>
600. O mullai vine, you are like a young girl.<br/>
Don’t hurt me with your smile<br/>
as you shine like the discus of the lord.<br/>
I go to you for refuge—please show me your love.<br/>
The young lord who cut off Surpanakha’s nose<br/>
promised he would never be apart from me.<br/>
If his promise is false, <br/>
it would be better if I had not been born.<br/>
<br/>
601. O cuckoo birds, you sing beautifully! <br/>
What is this song you are singing?<br/>
Come here and sing only <br/>
if the lord of the beautiful Venkaṭa hills<br/>
gives me his love and allows me to survive. <br/>
If the god with an eagle flag comes, <br/>
gives his grace and embraces me, <br/>
he can also listen to your songs. <br/>
<br/>
602. O flock of peacocks,<br/>
you have the beautiful color of the dear lord Kaṇṇan<br/>
and move gracefully<br/>
as if you had studied long to learn to dance. <br/>
I bow to your feet. <br/>
Do you see the sorrow of love that the dear god <br/>
resting eternally on Adisesha on the ocean<br/>
has given me? <br/>
<br/>
603. O lovely peacocks, <br/>
you dance beautifully spreading your wings.<br/>
I am pitiful and have no interest in seeing you dance. <br/>
Govindan, who dances the kudavai kuthu on a pot, <br/>
has taken all my feelings with him. <br/>
It is cruel of you to dance happily,<br/>
reminding me of him and giving me pain. <br/>
<br/>
604. O cloud, O cloud!<br/>
The thought that he has not entered my heart makes me suffer.<br/>
Like wax covered with sand that melts and pours down, <br/>
my love for him pours out. <br/>
Won’t you make the beautiful god of Venkaṭa hills <br/>
enter into my heart and embrace me?<br/>
<br/>
605. O milky ocean, O milky ocean! <br/>
Māyavan churned you and took the nectar from you. <br/>
He entered my heart, made me suffer and took my life away.<br/>
Will you go to him who rests on the snake bed<br/>
and tell him how I suffer for his love?<br/>
<br/>
606. O dear friend, our highest lord is divine but we are small.<br/>
He is wonderful and he rests on Adisesha, his snake bed. <br/>
What can we do for him?<br/>
Yet if Vishṇuchithan, the chief of Villiputhur,<br/>
summons his generous god by composing beautiful pāsurams, <br/>
and makes him come, we may be able to see him. <br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>The love of a girl for the lord of Srirangam<br/>
</strong><br/>
607. O friends adorned with precious jewels,<br/>
aren’t the bangles that I wear on my hands <br/>
as precious as the conch that he carries in his hand?<br/>
Won’t the lord of Srirangam<br/>
resting on the fiery-faced snake look at me?<br/>
It is very hard for me, very hard.<br/>
<br/>
608. O lovely women,<br/>
the sweet nectar-like lord of Srirangam <br/>
with his beautiful hair, mouth and eyes <br/>
and a lovely lotus on his navel with Nānmuhan on it <br/>
made my bangles loosen and fall.<br/>
Did he take them so he could wear them?<br/>
<br/>
609. With his scepter my dear lord of Srirangam <br/>
rules the world surrounded by roaring oceans<br/>
and the world of the sky, keeping trouble away from them.<br/>
Would my bangles that he has made loose <br/>
help him remove all the troubles of the world <br/>
and keep it prosperous?<br/>
<br/>
610. Vamanan, the divine god of Srirangam<br/>
filled with beautiful palaces and walls, <br/>
went to Mahābali in ancient times as a sage,<br/>
made him pour water on his hands,<br/>
cheated him and took his lands.<br/>
Wasn’t that enough for him?<br/>
If he wants my bangles also can’t he come to my street <br/>
and ask for them?<br/>
<br/>
611. The lord who rests on the snake bed<br/>
in Srirangam where good people live<br/>
went to Mahābali as the cheating Vāmanan<br/>
and made him give him his land<br/>
by pouring water on his golden hands<br/>
and measured all the worlds and the sky.<br/>
We are poor and have little.<br/>
It seems he wants to take the little things <br/>
that we have in our hands. <br/>
<br/>
612. He is the beloved god of Srirangam <br/>
where the Kaveri river flows<br/>
carrying riches from everywhere and nourishing the fields.<br/>
He is the inner meaning of the four Vedas <br/>
and cannot be reached by anyone, high or low. <br/>
He already stole my bangles<br/>
and now he has stolen my heart.<br/>
<br/>
613. When he had the form of Rāma,<br/>
the divine god of Srirangam<br/>
surrounded by strong walls<br/>
suffered as he thought of his wife Sita. <br/>
He didn’t eat or sleep when he was without her<br/>
and he made a bridge over the ocean <br/>
to bring her back from Lanka.<br/>
We are separated from him,<br/>
but he doesn’t worry about us <br/>
and thinks only of making himself happy. <br/>
<br/>
614. He, the bright lord, took the form of an unclean pig <br/>
in ancient times, split open the ground <br/>
and rescued the earth goddess <br/>
when an Asuran hid her in the underworld.<br/>
Even if I don’t want to think of the promises<br/>
that the beautiful shining god of Srirangam made to me,<br/>
I cannot forget them. <br/>
<br/>
615. When Sisupalan wanted to marry Rukmini,<br/>
after all the arrangements had made,<br/>
Kannan fought him, took Rukmini with him and married her. <br/>
Sriranganathan, the lord of Srirangam, <br/>
will help me as he helped Rukmani. <br/>
<br/>
616. Vishṇuchithan composed pāsurams<br/>
describing the love between Kaṇṇan and the cowherd women.<br/>
They said, “the lord says,  ‘I love those who love me,’<br/>
but though we love him he does not love us.<br/>
He lies to us, but how can we prove it?”<br/>
<br/>
617. She tells her relatives, “You don’t understand <br/>
that I love only Mādhavan whom no one can know.<br/>
If you say you will make me marry someone else<br/>
you’re just talking like someone who is dumb and deaf.<br/>
He, the Nambi, left his birth mother<br/>
and was raised by Yashoda, his other mother.<br/>
Take me near his Madurai and leave me there <br/>
before he goes to the battlefield to fight with the wrestlers.”<br/>
<br/>
618. She says, “You, my relatives,<br/>
should not be ashamed that I love him.<br/>
All the neighbors know about our love.<br/>
Don’t try to make me the person I was before.<br/>
I have changed, I am in love with Kaṇṇan.<br/>
If you really want to save me, <br/>
take me to the cowherd village.<br/>
I will only survive if I see the Māyan<br/>
who measured the world as a dwarf.”<br/>
<br/>
619. She says to her relatives, <br/>
“When people know that I went with Kaṇṇan <br/>
and they blame you saying,<br/>
‘She left her father, mother and her dear relatives <br/>
and went away with someone,’<br/>
you will be hurt and you won’t be able<br/>
to avoid the disgrace that comes to you. <br/>
Kaṇṇan, the naughty son of Nandagopālan,<br/>
plays with the cowherd girls<br/>
and does many mischievous things.<br/>
Take me to the doorstep of Nandagopalan <br/>
and leave me there at midnight.<br/>
Māyavan comes to me often and stands before me.”<br/>
<br/>
620. Her breasts say, <br/>
“We will not look at the face of others,<br/>
only of him with a discus in his beautiful hand.”<br/>
They are covered with a fine sari <br/>
and become shy if they see common people.<br/>
They won’t even look at the doorsteps of others,<br/>
only the house of Govindan.<br/>
I don’t want to live here.<br/>
Take me to the banks of the Yamuna river and leave me there.”<br/>
<br/>
621. She says, “O mothers,<br/>
no one understand how much the love <br/>
that I have for him hurts me.<br/>
It will go away only if the dark ocean-colored god<br/>
embraces me with his arms. <br/>
Take me to the pond and leave me on the banks <br/>
where he climbed the kadamba tree,<br/>
jumped into the pond and danced on Kālingan <br/>
as if he were dancing on a battlefield.” <br/>
<br/>
622. She says, “The cool clouds of the rainy season, <br/>
the karuviḷai flowers, the kāyām blossoms, <br/>
and the lotus flowers all attract me and tell me, <br/>
‘Go to Rishikeshan’s place.<br/>
He is sweating, hungry, feels weak and wants food,<br/>
and he is looking for the wives of the rishis<br/>
to bring him something to eat.’<br/>
Take me to where he waits for food<br/>
and leave me there.” <br/>
<br/>
623. She says, “I am growing pallid,<br/>
my mind is confused and I have no sense of shame.<br/>
My mouth is becoming pale,<br/>
I don’t want to eat or sleep and I am growing thin.<br/>
If the god colored like the roaring ocean<br/>
puts on me his cool thulasi garland,<br/>
all these problems will go away. <br/>
Take me to the banyan tree <br/>
where Balarāman conquered the Asuran Pilamban<br/>
and leave me there.”<br/>
<br/>
624. She says, “He grazed the calves,<br/>
living among the families of cowherds in the forest,<br/>
and he was tied to the mortar by Yashoda. <br/>
O poor mothers, don’t gossip about these things.<br/>
Take me near Govardhana mountain<br/>
that he carried as a victorious umbrella <br/>
to stop the  rain and protect the cows.<br/>
Don’t get together and argue<br/>
about what you have heard from others,<br/>
don’t argue with each other.”<br/>
<br/>
625. She says, “My parrot in its cage <br/>
always says, ‘Govinda, Govinda!’<br/>
If I am angry at it and don’t feed it,<br/>
it calls him loudly and says, <br/>
‘O lord, you have measured the world!’<br/>
If I leave home and go to his place, <br/>
people will blame you<br/>
and my relatives and you will be ashamed. <br/>
Take me to Dwarapathi filled with high palaces<br/>
and leave me there.”<br/>
<br/>
626. Vishṇuchithan Kodai, the chief of Puduvai <br/>
filled with shining golden palaces <br/>
composed a garland of beautiful pāsurams with music<br/>
 how a beloved with long hair<br/>
tells her relatives her firm decision to join Kaṇṇan <br/>
and she asks them to take her on a pilgrimage <br/>
from Madurai to Dwarapathi and leave her with him.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams<br/>
they will reach Vaikuṇṭam.<br/>
-----------<br/><br/>
<strong>The love sickness of a girl <br/>
</strong><br/>
627. She says, “I love the dark Kaṇṇan <br/>
and I long to see him and suffer.<br/>
O mothers, your gossip is like pouring tamarind juice on a wound. <br/>
The dear lord does not know how this girl suffers.<br/>
Bring the colorful silk cloth that decorates his waist<br/>
and use it to fan me and make me cool.”<br/>
<br/>
628. She says, “I fell into the love-net of the highest lord<br/>
who rested on the soft banyan leaf as a baby. <br/>
Don’t gossip uselessly as if you were piercing someone with a spear. <br/>
He is a cowherd and grazes the cows holding a stick, <br/>
and he danced on a pot in Kuḍanthai.<br/>
Bring the cool thulasi garland of the dark-colored Kaṇṇan<br/>
to decorate my soft curly hair.”<br/>
<br/>
629.She says, “He killed Kamsan with his strong bow.<br/>
The glances from the corners of his eyes go through my heart <br/>
like sharp spears and make me weak and hurt,<br/>
but he doesn’t tell me, “Don’t worry!”<br/>
O mothers, if that matchless lord gives the garland <br/>
from his chest and doesn’t cheat me, <br/>
bring it and spread it on my chest.”<br/>
<br/>
630. She says, “He is as sweet as nectar,<br/>
the dark bull who stole butter and milk<br/>
from the cowherd women<br/>
has made me weak with love for him and I am heartbroken.<br/>
Who is there to relieve this sorrow?<br/>
If you bring the water that springs from his the nectar-like mouth,<br/>
and feed that to me, the weakness of my body <br/>
and my love sickness will go away.”<br/>
<br/>
631. She says, “Even when people weep, and even if they worship him, <br/>
he does not come before them and say, “Don’t be afraid!”<br/>
He, the matchless Neḍumāl, came, embraced me, entered my heart,<br/>
and now seems to follow me everywhere without ever leaving.<br/>
Sprinkle the water on my face<br/>
that comes from the holes of his flute<br/>
as he plays it walking behind his cows in the grove.” <br/>
<br/>
632. She says, “This world is unfair.<br/>
Thirumāl, the son of Nandagopan,<br/>
makes me suffer as if I were crushed <br/>
beneath the feet of a bull.<br/>
I can’t even move.<br/>
Bring the dust from where he has walked,<br/>
smear it on me, and I will survive."<br/>
<br/>
633. She says, " Carrying a victorious eagle flag, <br/>
he rules the world and all obey him.<br/>
Yashoda raised him but she only made him<br/>
like an unripe, bitter fruit.<br/>
If he embraces tightly my faultless breasts with his young strong arms,<br/>
my faults will go away and I will be happy.”<br/>
<br/>
634. She says, “I melt in my heart for him<br/>
who carried Govardhana mountain and I suffer.<br/>
He doesn’t even care whether I’m alive or not.<br/>
If I see that mischievous one who stole my heart, <br/>
I will take my useless breasts and throw them on his chest. <br/>
Perhaps that will make my fire-like anger cool.”<br/>
<br/>
635. She says, “If I cannot serve Govindan in this birth, <br/>
making my breasts happy,<br/>
what is the use of doing tapas in the future?<br/>
If he embraces me with his chest it would be good,<br/>
or if he looks at me and tells me the truth to my face, <br/>
saying, “I don’t want you, goodbye!” it would also be good. <br/>
If he doesn’t want me what is the use of waiting <br/>
without knowing what he wants?<br/>
Isn’t it better if he tells me the truth?”<br/>
<br/>
636. The chief of Villiputhur, Vishṇuchithan Kodai,<br/>
composed pāsurams about how a woman <br/>
with eyebrows more lovely than bows <br/>
loved the dear Kaṇṇan, the bright light of the cowherd village,<br/>
after he gave her pangs of love. <br/>
If devotees learn these pāsurams and worship him <br/>
they will not suffer in the ocean of sorrow.<br/>
------------<br/><br/>
<strong>Devotees seeing Kaṇṇan in Brindavan.<br/>
</strong><br/>
637. “Playing like a young calf,<br/>
he makes the cows crazy<br/>
as he goes behind his brother Baladevan.<br/>
Did you see that dark bull-like one?”<br/>
“We saw him grazing the cows and giving them water.<br/>
He loves them and plays with them in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
638. “Did you see Govardhanan<br/>
stealing the butter, eating it and smelling of ghee?<br/>
He left me and went to the cowherd village.”<br/>
“We saw the dark one adorned with garlands made of forest flowers. <br/>
He looked like the clouds shining with lightning<br/>
in Brindavan as he played there.” <br/>
<br/>
639. “Did you see Nambi Thirumāl when he was born as a child?<br/>
He bewitched all the young girls, telling unbelievable lies.<br/>
Did you see him coming here?”<br/>
“We saw him flying on Garuḍa<br/>
shielded by its wings from the heat in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
640. “He attracted me with his dark beautiful lotus eyes,<br/>
tied me to him with his love, pulled me and played with me.<br/>
Did you see him?”<br/>
“We saw him. He was like a baby elephant <br/>
covered with a cloth decorated with pearls. <br/>
We saw him sweating and playing in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
641. “Did you see Madhavan, my lord, my jewel?<br/>
He is like a pig that has been caught in a net and escaped.<br/>
Has no one seen him? Doesn’t he want to show himself to anyone?”<br/>
“We saw him. He was like a dark baby cloud<br/>
wearing golden clothes as he came on the street in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
642. “Did you see the naughty one,<br/>
his beautiful eyebrows bending like his Sarngam bow?<br/>
He doesn’t have any compassion for the young girls <br/>
who love him and is always bothering them. <br/>
He doesn’t know how to get along with others.”<br/>
“We saw the dark one with a fair face. <br/>
He looked like the bright sun rising from behind a hill. <br/>
We saw him in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
643. “Did you see him, beautiful and dark as a cloud?<br/>
Is his mind as dark as his body?<br/>
He makes many promises to girls but doesn’t keep them.<br/>
Doesn’t he have any compassion?”<br/>
“We saw him. He was bright as the sky filled with stars <br/>
when he came with a big crowd in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
644. “Did you see generous Thirumāl<br/>
carrying a white conch and a discus<br/>
and adorned with golden clothes?”<br/>
“We saw him as his lovely fragrant hair fell on his large arms <br/>
while he played in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
645. “He created Nānmuhan on a beautiful lotus<br/>
growing from his navel<br/>
so that Nānmuhan could create the whole world.<br/>
Did you see the faultless lord who created this world and plays in it?” <br/>
“We saw the lord returning from fighting<br/>
after killing the Rakshasa Thenugan<br/>
and the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam in the forest.  We saw him in Brindavan.”<br/>
<br/>
646. Vishṇuchithan Kodai composed pāsurams <br/>
about how the people saw the highest lord in Brindavan <br/>
who gave his grace to Gajendra the elephant <br/>
and saved him from the crocodile. <br/>
If devotees keep these pāsurams in their minds as a cure<br/>
they will live under the divine feet of the lord without leaving him. <br/>

4. Perumāl Thirumozhi  by Kulasekharazhvar (647 -751)</h3></center>
<strong>
When will I see my god, the lord of Thiruvarangam<br/>
</strong><br/>
647. When will the day come when my two eyes see <br/>
the dark god shining like a komalam jewel, <br/>
resting on his beautiful white shining bed, the king of snakes <br/>
with a thousand shining foreheads <br/>
that remove the darkness with their bright diamonds,  <br/>
as the god’s feet are washed<br/>
by the clear water of the Ponni river flowing<br/>
in the Thiruppadi of Srirangam. <br/>
When will my two eyes see him and feel happy?<br/>
<br/>
648. When will the day come<br/>
that I can praise wholeheartedly our god, Māyon, <br/>
decorated with fragrant garlands<br/>
and dark as a kāyām flower?<br/>
He stays in my mind like a pillar<br/>
and rests on the water in Srirangam <br/>
on the fiery snake that has a curving body <br/>
and a thousand heads that spit fire<br/>
and that looks like a canopy made of fresh flowers.<br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
649. When will the day come<br/>
when I can place flowers under his feet<br/>
and approach him with his devotees<br/>
as the good Nānmuhan with four faces<br/>
and eight beautiful eyes praises him with his four tongues? <br/>
Our dear lord shining like pure gold<br/>
keeps Nānmuhan on a lovely lotus on his navel <br/>
while he sleeps on the beautiful snake bed in Srirangam.<br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
650. When will the day come when I fold my hands <br/>
and worship the ocean-colored lord,<br/>
sprinkling pure fresh flowers with my hands<br/>
for him who split open the beak of the bird? <br/>
He is strong as a bull among the cowherds, <br/>
the king of the gods in the sky, <br/>
and is sweet Tamil and Sanskrit poetry. <br/>
The lord who carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows <br/>
rests on a snake bed in Srirangam<br/>
where sages without attachment<br/>
praise him with their tongues.<br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
651. When will the day come<br/>
when I worship, bowing my head, <br/>
and see the dear sapphire-colored lord <br/>
decorated with garlands<br/>
resting on the snake bed in Srirangam <br/>
that is rich and filled with palaces and beautiful porches? <br/>
He is praised by Narada and the rishi Thumburu there , <br/>
playing sweet matchless music on their yāzhs<br/>
and Nānmuhan, adorned with beautiful flowers, <br/>
worships him constantly with the incomparable ancient Vedas. <br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
652. When will the day come when I worship<br/>
melting in my heart and see the divine face<br/>
bright as the moon and the lotus eyes of him<br/>
resting on the snake bed in beautiful Srirangam <br/>
surrounded by groves blooming with fragrant flowers?<br/>
Nānmuhan who stays on a beautiful lotus, <br/>
Shiva, Indira and all other gods, Apsarases <br/>
and wise sages join together and sprinkle flowers<br/>
in all the directions and worship him there. <br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
653. When will the day come <br/>
when my eyes, filled with tears, <br/>
see the dark-colored Māyon resting on the snake bed<br/>
in beautiful Srirangam on the Kaveri river?<br/>
He changes the evil hearts of people to good, <br/>
helps them control their five senses<br/>
and relieves them of the burden of their troubles and sickness,<br/>
making them his devotees <br/>
so they can follow the ways of dharma in their minds. <br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
654. When will the day come <br/>
when I who have done bad karma <br/>
can see and join happily the god <br/>
resting on the snake bed in Srirangam <br/>
surrounded by groves and flourishing fields where fish frolic? <br/>
He protects the world with his long bent bow, conch, <br/>
sword, his discus that destroys his enemies<br/>
and his vehicle Garuḍa that flies in the sky.<br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
655. When will the day come<br/>
when I worship, jumping and rolling on the ground,<br/>
and see the dear lord with a discus <br/>
resting on the snake bed in Srirangam<br/>
where the beating of beautiful drums <br/>
is like the sound of the ocean<br/>
and devotees, joined together in a group <br/>
and loving the lord in their minds, <br/>
sing devotional songs, <br/>
shed tears like rain and praise him happily?<br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
656. When will the day come<br/>
when I see the group of happy devotees<br/>
and join them and am joyful <br/>
in the divine temple of beautiful Srirangam<br/>
where Thirumāl rests facing south<br/>
giving  his grace so that the wide sky pours rain, <br/>
the gods in the heavens are saved, <br/>
the earth flourishes, <br/>
the people of the world survive,<br/>
the sorrow of people disappears, <br/>
good health increases in the world<br/>
and his devotees live happily?<br/>
When will I see him?<br/>
<br/>
657. Kulasekaran, the king with a strong army<br/>
who carries a victorious shining sword <br/>
and sits under a royal umbrella,<br/>
composed ten Tamil pāsurams praising the lord of Srirangam<br/>
who rests on the snake bed on Ponni river.<br/>
If devotees learn these pāsurams well and recite them <br/>
they will stay under the feet of Nāraṇan <br/>
who showers goodness to all. <br/>
-----------<br/><br/>
<strong>Lord of Southern Thiruvarangam. <br/>
</strong><br/>
658.  If I am able to see and join <br/>
the happy group of true devotees<br/>
who call, sing and dance, enthralled, <br/>
and think only of Rangan of south Srirangam, <br/>
as sweet as honey, hard to find, <br/>
decorated with garlands that never wither,<br/>
with the goddess of wealth seated on his chest,<br/>
that will be the purpose of this birth. <br/>
<br/>
659. If I can see and join the devotees <br/>
who praise him saying,<br/>
“O Ranga, you embrace Lakshmi, <br/>
seated on a lotus with blooming buds.<br/>
You cut down the tall mango tree with your shining sword<br/>
and you grazed the cows,”<br/>
and if I can think only of him and call him, <br/>
dance, sing and worship the dust on his devotees’ feet,<br/>
why should I desire to bathe in the Ganges? <br/>
<br/>
660. His devotees sing and praise him, saying, <br/>
“You conquered the bulls.<br/>
Taking the form of a boar you split the earth. <br/>
As Rāma you conquered your enemy Ravaṇan.<br/>
You came as a dwarf and measured the earth.”<br/>
When I see your devotees as they make the front yard<br/>
of Rangan’s temple wet with their tears <br/>
that are like the flow of abundant water of the rich Ponni river,<br/>
I will put on my head the good dust <br/>
that is beneath their divine feet.<br/>
<br/>
661. My heart praises and worships the divine feet<br/>
of the devotees who call, worship, melt and praise him, saying, <br/>
“Nāraṇa, you are our dear god. <br/>
You were not afraid that Yashoda might punish you <br/>
when she saw you stealing and eating the butter, <br/>
good yogurt and milk.<br/>
You stood there bravely and tapped your arms in front of her.” <br/>
<br/>
662. He has the color of a dark cloud<br/>
and carries a heroic bow.<br/>
He killed seven evil bulls, breaking their horns,<br/>
and he danced on the snake Kalingan.<br/>
My mind trembles<br/>
when I think of the devotees <br/>
whose bodies shake when they worship Rangan<br/>
of southern Srirangam <br/>
surrounded by strong shining stone walls.<br/>
<br/>
663. In all my births, my heart worships and praises <br/>
those devotees who love and serve Rangan<br/>
and wander everywhere to show <br/>
the faultless good path to sinners <br/>
who do not have devotion <br/>
and do not worship the divine feet of Thirumāl,<br/>
the lord without beginning or end, <br/>
the wonderful one, the dear god of the gods.<br/>
<br/>
664. My heart loves and praises<br/>
the feet of the devotees <br/>
who love Thirumāl and shed tears,<br/>
melting in their hearts as they worship him, <br/>
a bright wonderful light,<br/>
Rangan of Srirangam, with a red mouth, <br/>
teeth like pearls, a body dark as a cloud<br/>
and a chest decorated with Thulasi garlands. <br/>
<br/>
665. He has lovely flower-like eyes <br/>
and his divine mountain-like chest <br/>
wears a fragrant thulasi garland <br/>
swarming with bees and dripping with honey<br/>
as he rests on the milky ocean.<br/>
My heart falls in love with those devotees<br/>
who are fascinated by him <br/>
and wander, sing, dance and worship Rangan, our dear lord.<br/>
<br/>
666. The devotees of Rangan, my lord and father, <br/>
as they shed tears of joy, <br/>
tremble, long for him in their hearts<br/>
worship, dance and sing. <br/>
They seem mad but they are not.<br/>
It is those people who do not worship, dance, sing <br/>
and praise him who are truly mad. <br/>
<br/>
667. Kulasekharan, the king of Uraiyur,<br/>
the lord of Kuḍal Nagar and the protector of Kolli hills<br/>
composed sweet Tamil pāsurams on Rangan, <br/>
the beloved of Lakshmi.<br/>
He abides in the minds of his true devotees <br/>
if they think only of him and serve him as his slaves. <br/>
If they learn and recite these pāsurams <br/>
they will become the devotees of his devotees. <br/>
<br/>
668. All the people of this world <br/>
think that the false life on this earth is true.<br/>
I do not want to join them. <br/>
I call you, “O dear father, Ranga!”<br/>
and suffer falling in love with you, my Thirumāl. <br/>
<br/>
669. The people of the world <br/>
love women with beautiful waists as thin as threads.<br/>
I do not want to join them.<br/>
I call you, saying, “O Ranga who sleep on the banyan leaf,<br/>
my love increases for you, the Thirumāl,<br/>
and I suffer with love for you.”<br/>
<br/>
670. The people of this world fall in love when Kāma shoots<br/>
his mischievous arrows from his beautiful bow.<br/>
I do not want to join them.<br/>
My Rangan’s chest is adorned with garlands<br/>
and he is my good Nāraṇan who rests on Adisesha.<br/>
He saves his devotees from falling into hell. <br/>
I am crazy for him.<br/>
<br/>
671. The people of this world<br/>
crave food and clothes and search for them.<br/>
I do not want to join them.<br/>
See, he drank milk from the breasts of the cruel devil Putanā,<br/>
and I am crazy for Rangan, the lord of the world. <br/>
<br/>
672. I do not join with those who do evil things <br/>
when there are good things to do. <br/>
I am crazy for the ancient one, the cowherd, Rangan, <br/>
the beloved husband of innocent Lakshmi<br/>
seated on a beautiful lotus. <br/>
<br/>
673. I will not join people <br/>
if they are not the devotees of the highest. .<br/>
I do not think the life of any other god in the sky is best.<br/>
For all my seven births I want to be a crazy devotee <br/>
of my dear god of the gods of divine Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
674. My mind shuns the thought of joining anyone <br/>
who is not your devotee. <br/>
I call you, “O Thirumāl with beautiful eyes, <br/>
you are my Rangan, you are my lord!” <br/>
and I become crazy for you, my beloved. . <br/>
<br/>
675. Everyone in the world looks crazy to me.<br/>
and I am also crazy.<br/>
I tell this to all and call you, <br/>
“O cowherd, Ranga!”<br/>
and I become crazy for you, my dear lord.<br/>
<br/>
676. The king of Kongu country Kulasekharar <br/>
thinks only of the feet of him who rests on the ocean,<br/>
and he composed pāsurams about the devotees <br/>
who are crazy for the lord. <br/>
If devotees recite the words of Kulasekaran <br/>
they will have no troubles in their lives.<br/>
Lord of Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
<br/>
677. I do not want this body that is a bundle of flesh.<br/>
I want to be born as a kurugu bird that lives <br/>
on the branches of the trees in Thiruvenkaṭam <br/>
of him with a conch in his left hand<br/>
who conquered seven strong bulls.<br/>
I want only to be his slave.<br/>
<br/>
678. I do not want endless wealth or status,<br/>
I don’t want to be surrounded by heavenly women<br/>
or have the joy of ruling the sky <br/>
and a kingdom on the earth. <br/>
I want to be born as a fish in a spring<br/>
in Thiruvenkaṭam filled with groves <br/>
flourishing with flowers that drip honey. <br/>
<br/>
679. He carries a shining round discus.<br/>
Shiva with matted hair, Nanmuhan and Indra <br/>
could not enter the divine entrance of Vaikuṇṭam <br/>
even when they approached it,<br/>
but I will enter holding the golden plate <br/>
that the king of Thiruvenkaṭam ate from.<br/>
<br/>
680. Māyon rests on the cool milky ocean <br/>
where fertile coral-creepers float.<br/>
I would have the good fortune of blooming <br/>
as a shenbaga flower in Thiruvenkaṭam hills<br/>
where a swarm of bees sings and praises him. <br/>
I will see the feet of Māyon, decorated with anklets,<br/>
as he stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills. <br/>
<br/>
681. I do not want to sit <br/>
on the neck of a rutting elephant that frightens everyone<br/>
and know the joy of riding it.<br/>
I want to have the good fortune <br/>
of standing as a pole in the beautiful Venkaṭam hills<br/>
of our beloved lord. <br/>
<br/>
682. I do not want to enjoy <br/>
the dance and songs of heavenly women <br/>
like Urvasi and Menaka with waists as thin as lightning.<br/>
I want to have the good fortune of being a golden peak <br/>
in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
where bees swarm and sing “tenna, tenna.”<br/>
<br/>
683. I do not want the luxury of sitting <br/>
under a white royal umbrella <br/>
bright as the moon that rules the sky.<br/>
I want to be a forest river that flows <br/>
from the Thiruvenkaṭam hills surrounded with groves <br/>
blooming with flowers that drip honey. <br/>
<br/>
684. I want to be a path on the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
surrounded by cool fragrant groves,<br/>
where he stays who is the meaning of the Vedas<br/>
and who helped Nanmuhan, Indra<br/>
and Shiva with the crescent moon in his matted hair<br/>
when they performed sacrifices.<br/>
<br/>
685. O, Thirumāl, you take away the bad karma of all.<br/>
You are the highest ! You stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.<br/>
Devotees, the gods in the sky and Apsarases<br/>
stand at the entrance of your temple to see you.<br/>
I will become a step at the threshold of your temple<br/>
and I will see your coral mouth. <br/>
<br/>
686. Even if I were to become the king <br/>
of the world of the gods,<br/>
rule it beneath a sole umbrella <br/>
and enjoy the waist of Urvasi, <br/>
decorated with beautiful golden ornaments,<br/>
I would not want it.<br/>
I want to become anything on the golden hills<br/>
of Thiruvenkaṭam of my lord. . <br/>
<br/>
687. Kulasekharan with a sharp spear<br/>
that kills his enemies worshiped the lord <br/>
of Thiruvenkaṭam hills with cool and lovely slopes<br/>
and, wishing to see his golden shining feet, <br/>
composed pāsurams praising him. <br/>

they will become his good devotees. <br/>

<strong>Lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam.<br/>
</strong><br/>
688. You are the beloved lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam <br/>
surrounded with fragrant blooming groves.<br/>
Do not give me troubles—<br/>
I have no refuge but you.<br/>
I am like a crying child thinking of the love<br/>
of the mother who gave birth to it<br/>
even if she goes away when she is angry.<br/>
<br/>
689. A girl of a good family knows no one <br/>
except the husband who married her<br/>
even if he treats her so badly<br/>
that those who see hate him.<br/>
I am like her. You are my father,<br/>
the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam<br/>
surrounded by forts that touch the sky.<br/>
Even if you are like a husband and possess me, <br/>
I will praise only your feet decorated with sounding anklets.<br/>
<br/>
690. You are my father, the god of Vitruvakkoṭṭam<br/>
surrounded by fertile fields where fish swim.<br/>
Even if you do not look at me, <br/>
I have no refuge except you.<br/>
I am like those who live depending on the rule <br/>
of a king decorated with garlands <br/>
even if, unconcerned, he causes them much pain.<br/>
<br/>
691. O my father,  lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam, <br/>
a patient loves and does not leave a doctor <br/>
even when he cuts him with a knife and burns him.<br/>
I am like that patient. Even if you cause me pain<br/>
that I must bear, I am enthralled by you.<br/>
I am your slave and look only for your grace <br/>
and think you are my only friend.<br/>
<br/>
692. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkottam<br/>
who conquered the strong cruel-eyed elephant,<br/>
where can I go and be saved except beneath your feet?<br/>
I am like a huge bird that wanders<br/>
looking for the shore of the ocean with rolling waves<br/>
and, unable to find it, comes back<br/>
to the mast of a ship.<br/>
<br/>
693. You are my father, the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,<br/>
where red lotuses bloom only under the hot sun <br/>
even though the sun comes to the middle of the sky<br/>
and burns them with its heat.<br/>
I am like those lotuses. <br/>
Even if you do not take away my bad karma,<br/>
my heart only melts for your endless grace.<br/>
<br/>
694. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam, <br/>
even when it has not rained for a long time, <br/>
the green crops look at the huge dark clouds <br/>
floating in the sky hoping it will rain.<br/>
I am like them. I am your slave. <br/>
Even if my troubles will not go away,<br/>
my heart will look only for you.<br/>
<br/>
695. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam, <br/>
even if all the rivers come together<br/>
spread and flood everywhere, <br/>
they cannot stay where they are but must join the ocean. <br/>
I wish to join you as those rivers join the ocean. <br/>
O virtuous one who have the color of a dark shining cloud. <br/>
See, I have no way to find refuge <br/>
except to come to you for your grace. <br/>
<br/>
696. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam, <br/>
I want only you with a shining discus bright as lightning in your hand.<br/>
I think of you only as my wealth<br/>
and want no other riches. <br/>
I am your slave and I want only you.<br/>
<br/>
697 Kulasekharan with a victorious spear<br/>
loved the god and composed ten good Tamil pāsurams <br/>
praising Thirumāl and saying, “You are my father, <br/>
the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam.<br/>
Even if you do not give me your grace<br/>
I have no other refuge than your feet.”<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these ten excellent Tamil pāsurams <br/>
of Kulasekharan they will not go to hell. <br/>

<strong>Kaṇṇan and the cowherd girls.<br/>
</strong><br/>
698. “Many of the cowherd women in this town <br/>
decorated with fresh flowers <br/>
say they don’t want to embrace your chest<br/>
because you lied to them.<br/>
I am standing on a sand dune <br/>
on the bank of the Yamuna river<br/>
shaking in the cold that comes after a strong rain.<br/>
O Vasudeva, I am waiting for you to come.”<br/>
<br/>
699. “You saw a lovely girl with beautiful fish-like eyes <br/>
churning yogurt in her home near you<br/>
and you entered her house like a thief and said, <br/>
‘I will also churn yogurt.’<br/>
When the girl with long beautiful hair<br/>
that was decorated with flowers swarming with bees<br/>
saw you, her bright face sweated and her red mouth quivered.<br/>
O Damodara, I know truly how you churn the yogurt!”<br/>
<br/>
700. “You looked at one girl <br/>
with dark hair adorned with flowers,<br/>
you approached another girl and your heart fell for her,<br/>
you told another girl about her,<br/>
you told lies to another innocent girl,<br/>
and you embraced a curly-haired young girl,<br/>
but you are not true to any of them.<br/>
O you who destroyed the wrestlers <br/>
when they came as marudu trees,<br/>
as you grow, your magic grows with you.”<br/>
<br/>
701. “Even though there is nectar-like milk<br/>
in your mother’s breast, you crawled <br/>
and toddled to the devil Putanā,<br/>
put your mouth to her breasts <br/>
and drank her poisonous milk. <br/>
Those who saw you called you crazy.<br/>
I am here and I love you,<br/>
but you got together with the girl <br/>
I sent as a messenger and enjoyed her.<br/>
Is that also one of your naughty deeds?”<br/>
<br/>
702. “I saw you wearing golden silk clothes <br/>
as you went on the street in the dark night <br/>
with another girl with a thin lightning-like waist. <br/>
I stood there and saw how you looked at her <br/>
as she looked at you,<br/>
but you were also gesturing with your hands<br/>
to call another girl who saw you. <br/>
Why have you left them all and returned?<br/>
Dear one, go back to them now.”<br/>
<br/>
703. “O Vasudeva with strong heroic arms,<br/>
did I do something to get bad karma?<br/>
When I went to rest in the middle of the night, <br/>
you left me on the bed alone,<br/>
and not only that night, my dear one, <br/>
but other nights also. <br/>
And after you embraced young girls, <br/>
you came back to me.<br/>
Why did you come back and leave them?<br/>
O dear one, get up and go to them.” <br/>
<br/>
704. “O you who rest on the snake bed of Adishesha,<br/>
we are not like the ones you knew before, <br/>
not like those you loved <br/>
with beautiful eyes darkened with kohl. <br/>
Stop coming to our village and staying here. <br/>
It is enough that we fell for you, <br/>
looking at your beautiful clothes, divine face,<br/>
fruit-like red lips and listening to the music of your flute.<br/>
If we hear your lies for one day, that is enough. <br/>
Stop saying your cheating words to attract us. <br/>
O young one, please go away.”<br/>
<br/>
705. “You asked me to come here<br/>
but you went to the pandal blooming<br/>
with clusters of jasmine and loved her.<br/>
When you saw me, you muttered <br/>
as if your heart was melting for me.<br/>
Even though you brought a golden dress for me<br/>
and lied that you love me before you went away,<br/>
when you come to see me again <br/>
I will still care for you,<br/>
and if I see you my anger may go away.”<br/>
<br/>
706. “Your chest is decorated <br/>
with lovely, auspicious flower garlands<br/>
and you wear peacock feathers in your hair.<br/>
Your bright clothes are beautiful <br/>
and your ears are adorned with a bunch of flowers. <br/>
You played sweet music on the flute for the girls, <br/>
with hair adorned with fragrant kongu flowers <br/>
and flirted with them.<br/>
Would you come and play music <br/>
on your flute one day to enthrall us”<br/>
<br/>
707. Kulasekharan, the chief of Kolli hills <br/>
composed ten sweet Tamil pāsurams<br/>
describing how the young cowherd girls <br/>
fell in love with the beloved of beautiful goddess Lakshmi <br/>
and how they expressed their wish<br/>
to fight with him lovingly in the night.<br/>
If devotees recite with music these ten sweet Tamil pāsurams<br/>
of Kulasekaran, they will have no troubles in life. <br/>

<strong>Devaki's Lullaby to Krishna. <br/>
</strong><br/>
708. “You are as sweet as the sugarcane juice <br/>
that comes from a sugarcane press, thālo.<br/>
Your big eyes are lovely as lotuses in the water, thālo.<br/>
Your color is like the water of the ocean, thālo.<br/>
You are the king who killed the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam, thālo.<br/>
You are my son with handsome fragrant hair, thālo.<br/>
I am more unlucky than all other mothers <br/>
because I don’t have the good fortune <br/>
of singing a lullaby and saying “thālo, thālo” for you.” <br/>
<br/>
709. “Your lotus eyes darkened with kohl are beautiful<br/>
as you look up and see the decorations on the cradle.<br/>
You look like a baby cloud.<br/>
As you bend your legs and put your fingers in your mouth,<br/>
you look like an elephant bending its trunk and sleeping.<br/>
O Kesava, I don’t have the good fortune<br/>
of seeing these things when you are a baby.”<br/>
<br/>
710. “Mothers from good families<br/>
keep their children on their laps and say,<br/>
‘You are my dear one, <br/>
you are the bright light of our family,<br/>
you are like a bull that has the color of a cloud.’ <br/>
When someone asked you, ‘Who is your father?’<br/>
you looked at Nandagopan out of the corner of your eyes <br/>
and pointed at him with your beautiful fingers.<br/>
Vasudevan, our chief, does not have the good fortune <br/>
of being your father.”<br/>
<br/>
711. “O Kaṇṇa, your face is like the shining full moon,<br/>
your hands, chest and arms are strong,<br/>
your dark hair is adorned with fresh flowers,<br/>
your forehead is like the crescent moon<br/>
and your eyes are like lotuses blooming in a pond.<br/>
I do not have the fortune of seeing<br/>
you with my eyes when you are a baby<br/>
even though I think of myself as your mother.<br/>
I am unlucky and I don’t have the pleasure <br/>
of raising my child, yet still I am alive.”<br/>
<br/>
712. “You kissed your father Nandagopan<br/>
and your mother Yashoda with your beautiful lips<br/>
as the chuṭṭi ornament on your beautiful forehead swung around.<br/>
You put your sweet fingers into your lovely mouth <br/>
and prattled innocently.<br/>
When your father saw you like that <br/>
his heart was filled with joy, <br/>
but I did not have the good fortune of seeing those things<br/>
or listening to your baby talk.<br/>
Only the divine Yashoda has known that joy.” <br/>
<br/>
713. “O Kaṇṇa with cool lotus eyes,<br/>
you crawled and toddled in the cowherd village<br/>
and you played in the red sand.<br/>
I don’t have the good fortune of embracing you <br/>
and covering my chest with the red sand you played in.<br/>
When you eat your food you scatter it all over.<br/>
I never had the good fortune of eating<br/>
what was left over on your plate.<br/>
Surely, my karma is bad.<br/>
What is the use of my mother gave birth to me?”<br/>
<br/>
714. “O sweet one, my lovely child, Govinda,<br/>
babies hold on to one of their mothers’ breasts <br/>
with their young beautiful hands<br/>
that are as tender as shoots and drink milk. <br/>
They look at their mother’s face and smile at them. <br/>
I don’t have the fortune of feeding you milk like that.”<br/>
<br/>
715. “You took butter with your small lotus-bud-like hands and ate it. <br/>
When Yashoda brought a rope you were afraid she was going to hit you<br/>
and, your beautiful mouth smeared with yogurt,<br/>
you were scared as you looked at her and cried<br/>
and your small red mouth trembled.<br/>
Then you folded your hands and worshipped her<br/>
and when she saw this, she found endless joy.”<br/>
<br/>
716. “You stopped the rain with Govardhana mountain <br/>
and protected the cows.<br/>
You danced the beautiful kuravai dance<br/>
and danced on a pot. <br/>
You picked up the Rakshasas when they came as calves, <br/>
threw them at the vilam fruit tree and killed them.<br/>
You danced on the head of Kalingan the snake. <br/>
I never saw how you played like this as a child—<br/>
my heart never felt the joy of seeing these things. <br/>
Give me your grace that I may see you play like that <br/>
if you can do it again.”<br/>
<br/>
717. “When you drank milk from the breasts of Putanā, <br/>
the evil-hearted one, her body became withered, <br/>
blood flowed out and her nerves were broken.<br/>
You survived even though you drank her poisonous milk<br/>
and gave your grace to all.<br/>
O my father who are like a dark cloud,<br/>
who took the life of Kamsan,<br/>
my breasts are a burden to me and I cannot use them.<br/>
I think I will see you one day <br/>
and that is the only thing I am living for.<br/>
You have a good mother, Yashoda.”<br/>
<br/>
718. Kulasekharan the king of Kolli<br/>
who bowed down with his head and worshiped Kaṇṇan <br/>
wrote a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams <br/>
describing how Devaki was sad not to have the fortune<br/>
of seeing her son grow up <br/>
who fought with Kamsan the king of Madura and killed him.<br/>
If devotees learn and recite these fine musical Tamil pāsurams <br/>
they will be with Naraṇan soon.<br/>

You are the dark jewel of Kaṇṇapuram <br/>

<strong>The story of Rāma—Dasharatha suffers when Rama goes to forest.<br/>
</strong><br/>
730. Dasaratha says, “You were going to become king <br/>
as the people of this flourishing country <br/>
bowed to your strong feet and worshipped you.<br/>
When you were about to sit on the throne, <br/>
O Rāma, your step-mother said, <br/>
‘Go and stay for a long time in the large forest.’<br/>
I listened to the words of Kaikeyi, your mother, <br/>
and asked you to go to the forest.<br/>
O my dear son, that is what I did to you!”<br/>
<br/>
731. Dasaratha says, “You listened to my cruel words<br/>
and left quickly, leaving this kingdom<br/>
with its victorious elephants, chariots and horses <br/>
and went to the forest.<br/>
Your lovely wife, decorated with ornaments, <br/>
her long eyes like spears smeared with oil,<br/>
and your younger brother Lakshmana followed you. <br/>
How could you walk in that cruel forest?<br/>
O our Rāma! You are my dear lord. <br/>
What can I do?”<br/>
<br/>
732. Dasaratha says, “You, with your mountain-like arms that can fight anyone,<br/>
the son of the family of Kosalai <br/>
whose long red-lined eyes are like murderous spears,<br/>
know how to melt my heart.<br/>
Before you slept on a soft bed in the palace—<br/>
how are you going to sleep <br/>
under the shadow of a tree in the large forest?<br/>
How could you learn to sleep on a stone bed,<br/>
O dark king of the dynasty of Kahustha?” <br/>
<br/>
733. Dasaratha says, “Come here and go back to the forest,<br/>
come and see me one more time before you go. <br/>
O you who broke the bow of Shiva who rides the bull<br/>
to marry your wife Sita <br/>
with lovely hair decorated with flowers<br/>
and beautiful bamboo-like arms.<br/>
Now you are going to the wide forest<br/>
and you make my heart suffer. <br/>
Surely I must have done bad karma.<br/>
My son, you are leaving, <br/>
yet my heart does not split in two."<br/>
<br/>
734. Dasaratha says, “Your soft feet will hurt <br/>
when you walk on the gravel with stones<br/>
as sharp as the points of the spears enemies hold,<br/>
and they may bleed. <br/>
Willingly you are going to the forest <br/>
where no one wishes to go.<br/>
The sun will be hot and hunger will cause you cruel pain.<br/>
My son, you are going now<br/>
because I, a sinner, listened to the evil daughter of king Kaikeyan.<br/>
Surely I must have done bad karma. What can I do to stop you?”<br/>
<br/>
735. Dasaratha says, “From now on<br/>
I will not hear anyone lovingly calling me “amma.”<br/>
No more will I feel the tight embrace <br/>
of his ornamented chest on my chest.<br/>
I cannot kiss him on his forehead,<br/>
I will not be able to see his majestic walk <br/>
that is like the stride of an elephant,<br/>
I will not be able to see his lotus face anymore.<br/>
I have lost my dear one, my son.<br/>
Surely I have done terrible deeds, yet I am still alive.”<br/>
<br/>
736. Dasaratha says, “His hair that was decorated<br/>
with fragrant flowers is matted into jaṭa now. <br/>
He would wear lovely, soft garments on his waist<br/>
but now he wears orange clothes like a renunciant<br/>
and he does not wear any ornaments. <br/>
Is it right that my son with such handsome arms<br/>
should go to the forest instead of me?<br/>
O, Sumanthra, O sage Vashisṭa, <br/>
you are learned men of the Vedas. Tell me!”<br/>
<br/>
737. Dasaratha says, “O Kaikeyi,<br/>
you have sent to the forest my divine son, as precious as gold, <br/>
his brother Lakshmaṇa and my gentle-natured daughter-in-law<br/>
with a waist as thin as lightning<br/>
and words as sweet as a puvai bird’s.<br/>
People will blame your own son Bharatha <br/>
for what you have done<br/>
and you are going to make me go to heaven in the sky.<br/>
What are you going to get from all this?<br/>
O Kaikeyi, how could you live happily in this large world?”<br/>
<br/>
738. Dasaratha says, “You broke the bow<br/>
of axe-carrying Parasurāma and destroyed his tapas.<br/>
Without thinking how I will suffer<br/>
and without thinking how your mother will suffer,<br/>
you just listened to my words <br/>
and my promise to your step-mother <br/>
and left for the forest. <br/>
You are my dear one. <br/>
I wish that you could be born as my son <br/>
for the next seven births.<br/>
May I have that fortune,<br/>
O king with long, strong arms.”<br/>
<br/>
739. Dasaratha says, “I heard the cruel words<br/>
of the evil Kaikeyi who followed the advice of Kuni<br/>
and now I will leave Sumithra to suffer<br/>
and Kosalai with hair filled with flowers that drip honey.<br/>
You are going to the forest, leaving this rich palace happily,<br/>
and I will leave this place <br/>
and go to the gods’ world happily,<br/>
O king of the dynasty of Manu.”<br/>
<br/>
740. Dasharatha, adorned with garlands,<br/>
his arms strong as mountains, suffered when his son, <br/>
the beautiful dark Neḍumāl, went to the forest.<br/>
Kulasekharan, the king of Kozhiyur <br/>
who carries a sharp spear and rules under a royal umbrella<br/>
composed ten Tamil pāsurams <br/>
that describe the suffering of Dasharatha.<br/>
If devotees learn these Tamil pāsurams <br/>
they will avoid the bad paths of life. <br/>

<strong>God Rama of Thillai Chitrakuḍam. <br/>
</strong><br/>
741. Rāma, tall, with beautiful eyes, <br/>
colored like a dark cloud, <br/>
our dear king, our lord,<br/>
the light that illuminates the whole world,<br/>
stays in beautiful Ayodhya surrounded by high walls.<br/>
Born in the dynasty of the sun, <br/>
he brightens that royal line, and he conquered the whole sky<br/>
and is the god of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.<br/>
When will the day come <br/>
when I see him joyfully with my eyes?<br/>
------<br/><br/>
<strong>The Story of Rāma.<br/>
</strong><br/>
742. He  saved the sacrifice of the rishi Vishwamithra, <br/>
learned in all the mantras and the Vedas <br/>
shot a strong arrow and split open the chest of Thaḍagai <br/>
when she came to fight him, making her blood flow out, <br/>
and he killed all the strong Rakshasas.<br/>
See, our dear god stays in the Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai,<br/>
surrounded with cool flourishing groves <br/>
blooming with flowers with green tender leaves, <br/>
as he sits on a throne studded with diamonds,<br/>
praised by three thousand Andaṇars.<br/>
<br/>
743. To marry Sita whose long dark lovely eyes were lined with red,<br/>
the heroic Rāma who conquered kings with sharp spears, <br/>
broke the bow of Shiva, the angry bull rider carrying a mazhu weapon.<br/>
He stays in divine Chithrakuḍam in Thillai surrounded by tall walls.<br/>
I worship the feet of the worshipers of Rāma<br/>
whose cruel bow conquers his mighty enemies.<br/>
<br/>
744. As Rāma he left his kingdom, obeying the words of Kaikeyi <br/>
whose curly hair was decorated with bunches of fresh flowers, <br/>
went to the forest, <br/>
crossed the Ganges with the help of Guhan, his dear devotee,<br/>
and gave his sandals and his kingdom to Bharathan<br/>
when his brother came to see him.<br/>
He stays in beautiful Chithrakuḍam in Thillai.<br/>
If devotees see him happily with their two eyes, <br/>
they will be equal to the gods in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
745. As Rāma he killed the Rakshasa Virāḍan<br/>
with strong mountain-like arms,<br/>
received a bow from the sage Agasthya, creator of rich Tamil,<br/>
cut off the nose of the beautiful Rakshasi Surpanakha, <br/>
took the lives of Karan and Dushanan, <br/>
and bent his bow and shot arrows to kill the Raksasa Mārisan<br/>
when he came as a golden deer.<br/>
He stays in Chithrakuḍam in Thillai<br/>
and this earth is fortunate that his devotees wander there<br/>
bowing their heads and worshiping him.<br/>
<br/>
746. As Rāma he was separated from Vaidehi, his lovely wife.<br/>
He was sad when Jaṭāyu was killed by Ravanan and sent to Vaikuṇṭam, <br/>
he became friends with the king of monkeys' Sugrivan<br/>
and he killed Vali in the Kishkinda forest,<br/>
relieving the suffering of Sugrivan.<br/>
He made Hanuman burn Lanka<br/>
ruled by Ravaṇan, the king of the Rakshasas,<br/>
so that Hanuman’s anger would abate.<br/>
I worship the feet of the devotees of Rāma,<br/>
the dear god who stays happily in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.<br/>
<br/>
747. As Rāma he shot his arrows to calm the stormy ocean, <br/>
made a bridge with the help of the monkeys <br/>
and reached Lanka on the other side of the sea.<br/>
He killed the Rakshasas who carried strong long spears,<br/>
took the life of Ravaṇa the king of Lanka <br/>
and gave the kingdom to Ravaṇa’s brother Vibhishaṇa, <br/>
and returning to Ayodhya with his wife as lovely as Lakshmi,<br/>
he was seated on his throne.<br/>
I will not consider anyone my king <br/>
except Rāma the god of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.<br/>
<br/>
748. Rāma who reached Ayodhya filled with gold<br/>
and beautiful diamond-studded palaces, <br/>
heard his own story<br/>
from the mouths, red as coral, of his two sons <br/>
born to Sita, the princess of Mithila, to save the world.<br/>
If we hear and drink in the story of Rāma <br/>
of Thiruchithrakudam in Thillai<br/>
we have no need of sweet nectar. <br/>
<br/>
749. Rāma is adorned with a jewel-studded ornament<br/>
given by an Andanan who knew the Vedas <br/>
because he saved his son. <br/>
His brother Laksmaṇa killed the Rakshasa Ilavaṇan <br/>
and Rāma granted him moksha.<br/>
He was separated from his brother Laksmaṇa<br/>
by the curse of the sage Durvasa.<br/>
If our hearts never forget the lord <br/>
of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai,<br/>
we will not have any trouble in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
750. When the dear lord adorned with garlands<br/>
returned from the forest, the gods in the sky welcomed him.<br/>
By the grace of him who fought with the strong Asuras<br/>
and conquered them<br/>
all people and creatures in the world go to Vaikuṇṭam.<br/>
He stays always in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.<br/>
O devotees of Rāma, praise him saying, “avan ivan!” <br/>
and worship him always.<br/>
<br/>
751. Kulasekharan, the king of Uṛaiyur,<br/>
who rules under a royal umbrella <br/>
and carries a victorious shining sword <br/>
composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams <br/>
describing the endless fame of Rāma,<br/>
the son of Dasharatha and the friend of Hanumān. <br/>
If devotees know and recite these ten sweet Tamil pāsurams<br/>
they will approach the feet of Nāraṇan who shines with goodness.<br/>

You are many wisdoms,<br/>

the five sense organs, body, mouth, eyes, nose and ears,<br/>
the five organs of action, mouth, legs, hands, the unclean organs, <br/>
the five senses, taste, sight, hearing, smell and touch <br/>

You who stay in the sky are all these and more. <br/>
O Māyan, who can see you?<br/>
<br/>
755. You are the thirty-three Sanskrit sounds.<br/>
You are the five consonants, <br/>

No one knows who you are <br/>

and he creates all creatures of the world.<br/>
<br/>
757. Adisesha carries the earth and you, <br/>

Shiva with red matted hair<br/>
adorned with kondrai garlands that drip pollen<br/>
worships your feet as the Vedas say. <br/>
The Vediyars who know the Vedas well <br/>
and the sages who recite the sacrificial mantras<br/>
worship you through the right paths that the sastras prescribe.<br/>
<br/>
761. Just as the white waves born in the wide ocean<br/>
rise and go back into the ocean,<br/>
everything that is in the world is born from you, <br/>
stays and lives in the world by your grace <br/>
and goes back into you. Such is your nature. <br/>

all the creatures of the world by your order.<br/>
<br/>

Who knows how you are in this world?<br/>
<br/>
764. No one can say just what or who you are. <br/>
Some say that you are the beloved of Nappinnai, <br/>
and some say you are only a cowherd <br/>

your birth and what form you will take in the future?<br/>
No one can know your nature.<br/>

Your greatness is like that of high mountains. <br/>

took the form of a swan <br/>
and taught the Vedas to the sages, <br/>
split open the mouth of the Asuran<br/>

the snake that is an enemy of the eagle?<br/>
<br/>
771. Without being shy,<br/>
you rest on a snake on the ocean<br/>
and the gods come there and sing and praise you. <br/>

When you churned the ocean of milk<br/>

What did the Asuras do?<br/>

You are our father! <br/>
Tell us how all that happened so we can understand you. <br/>

820. If you see some gods, they have terrible forms<br/>
and their praise is not sweet to the ears. <br/>
Even if you praise them they do not have the power<br/>
to give the boons you ask for. <br/>
O ignorant ones! <br/>
You live thinking they are your refuge.<br/>
If you want to survive, <br/>
there is only one refuge for you, our Thirumāl. <br/>
If you wish to release yourself from births, <br/>
worship our ancient Thirumāl.. <br/>
<br/>
821. The gods in the sky, <br/>
carrying clubs, tridents, spears, drums, sticks and swords,<br/>
ran everywhere and hid <br/>
when Bānasuran came to fight with them. <br/>
On that day our Thirumāl fought with him<br/>
and cut off his thousand arms, <br/>
and took away all the troubles of the gods. <br/>
<br/>
822. When Kaṇṇan took Usha,<br/>
and her father Bānasuran, knowing what had happened, <br/>
came to fight with him,<br/>
Kaṇṇan cut off his thousand arms<br/>
and Shiva, Agni and the other gods<br/>
who had come to help Bānasuran retreated.<br/>
Then, the Māyan forgave the Asuran and gave him moksha. <br/>
<br/>
823. The goddess Lakshmi stays on a lotus,<br/>
the earth goddess stays with Thirumāl,<br/>
while Nānmuhan, the god’s son, sits on the lotus on his navel. <br/>
The sastras say that Shiva who shares his body with his wife<br/>
became his vehicle.<br/>
That is the truth and no one can deny it.<br/>
<br/>
824. He shot his arrows <br/>
and made holes in the seven mara trees.<br/>
As Rāma, he shot his arrows at Vali's chest and killed him. <br/>
Even the rulers of the sky<br/>
will not receive the endless joy of moksha <br/>
unless our god has given them his grace to receive it.<br/>
<br/>
825. If you really know that your refuge is the feet of him<br/>
who took the form of Vāmanan and worship him, <br/>
you will have wealth and wonderful wisdom.<br/>
If you praise Thirumāl <br/>
who rests on the ocean with its clear rolling waves, <br/>
you will not have the results of your bad karma.<br/>
<br/>
826. Only those who do good tapas thinking only of the lord <br/>
and who think constantly of the nature of Thirumāl <br/>
will go to heaven and stay with the other gods forever. <br/>
Except for those devotees no one can see the lovely-eyed Thirumāl. <br/>
<br/>
827. Only if people control the feelings that arise from their senses<br/>
and light up their wisdom by following the good path <br/>
and melt in their bones and hearts for him <br/>
and love him who carries a discus can they see him. CHECK<br/>
<br/>
828. The ancient lord is eight and eight and eight,<br/>
he is seven and seven and seven,<br/>
and he is eight and three and one.<br/>
Devotees worshiping with the eight letter mantra,<br/>
“Om namo Nārāyaṇāya,” will go to heaven and rule there. <br/>
<br/>
829. If people love him tirelessly<br/>
and think of him always in their minds,<br/>
reciting the eight-letter mantra with love<br/>
and worshiping the beautiful ankleted feet<br/>
of the god who rests on the snake bed on the ocean, <br/>
they will go to heaven and rule there. <br/>
<br/>
830. He is the ten directions, <br/>
the soul of the ten guardians of the directions, <br/>
the nine notes of music, the nine rasas of dance <br/>
and he, the ancient and the most powerful one,<br/>
came to this world in ten avatharams.<br/>
Only if devotees worship him with devotion <br/>
will they reach moksha. <br/>
<br/>
831. When the Asuran Thenugam approached the lord without love<br/>
pretending to be his friend, he cut off his arms <br/>
but then he gave him moksa. <br/>
No one can reach moksha except the devotees<br/>
who worship the ankleted feet of the lord with love..<br/>
<br/>
832. The lord  stays in the Thiruvenkatam hills<br/>
who churned the milky ocean<br/>
and rests on the ocean forever.<br/>
He gave his grace to Vāli after killing him,<br/>
and destroyed the seven trees with one arrow<br/>
If you worship the feet of Thirumāl you will be saved.<br/>
<br/>
833. You who rest on the snake bed on the ocean, <br/>
the highest of the high, <br/>
are the incomparable one whom no one can know.<br/>
If devotees have destroyed their desires <br/>
and released themselves from attachment to the world,<br/>
they will receive happiness here, there and everywhere in all ways.<br/>
<br/>
834. O you who wear cool thulasi garlands that drip pollen,<br/>
if someone controls his mind and worships you<br/>
with the eight letter mantra, “Om Namo Narayanaya,”<br/>
the joy he receives is higher than the joy of attaining moksha.<br/>
<br/>
835. Does he who  carries the discus <br/>
want me to be born again?<br/>
Does he know the day he made me love his ankleted feet?<br/>
I am ignorant, incapable of doing anything,<br/>
and do not know how to love him.<br/>
O dear lord, what did you find in me <br/>
to make me your devotee?<br/>
<br/>
836. O lord resting on the snake bed,<br/>
I know your magic. <br/>
You know how to make my mind <br/>
that is interested in other worldly things<br/>
leave them and be devoted to your lotus feet. <br/>
You are truly clever.<br/>
If you make me fascinated with you, <br/>
what kind of fascination is that? <br/>
O Māyan, give me your grace <br/>
so I am not involved in worldly things. <br/>
<br/>
837. Dance, dance with your feet. <br/>
You danced on the heads of the snake Kālingan <br/>
stirring the water in the pond,<br/>
O you who carry a conch in your hand.<br/>
I worship your beautiful feet every day<br/>
and think of you always. <br/>
Why have you not granted me moksha yet, O Kaṇṇa. <br/>
<br/>
838. You are the Vedas. <br/>
Shiva with an eye in his forehead,<br/>
the wise Nānmuhan staying on the lotus <br/>
and all other gods together worship your feet with love.<br/>
I will not speak of any other love <br/>
except the love that I have for you. <br/>
<br/>
839. My generous lord churned the milky ocean,<br/>
using the mountain for a churning stick,<br/>
a turtle to support the mountain<br/>
and the white-fanged snake Vasuki for the rope. <br/>
He took the nectar that came from the ocean,<br/>
gave it to the gods in the sky,<br/>
and took away their troubles.<br/>
I will not worship any one except him. <br/>
<br/>
840. You became the charioteer for Arjuna, <br/>
destroyed the Kauravas<br/>
and gave the land to the five Pandavas, <br/>
sending their enemies to the sky<br/>
and saving the earth from evil ones.<br/>
O victorious one, I will not worship any other except you. . <br/>
<br/>
841. I was not born in one of the four varnas. <br/>
I have not learned any of the good arts <br/>
and do not recite the Vedas with my tongue. <br/>
I have not conquered the joy given by the senses.<br/>
O pure one, I have no good knowledge<br/>
and I have no refuge except your shining feet. <br/>
<br/>
842. For the sake of Sita with sharp sword-like eyes<br/>
and soft words like music <br/>
you burned countless Raksasas in Lanka.<br/>
I have no eyes except yours that make me see<br/>
and no relatives to be with except you. <br/>
You have endless magic. <br/>
How can I ever take you from my heart?<br/>
<br/>
843. O cowherd who destroyed the seven bulls <br/>
and embraced the arms of Nappinnai and married her <br/>
with spear-like eyes that attracted all,<br/>
you created the oceans, you churned the milky ocean <br/>
and you rest on it. I come to you as my refuge.<br/>
Give me refuge, tell me, “Don’t be afraid!”<br/>
<br/>
844. You, the god of Srirangam, <br/>
adorned with a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,<br/>
give your grace to those who love and worship your feet. <br/>
You, as sweet as a bundle of sugarcane,<br/>
are Kaṇṇan resting on the ocean. <br/>
As Rāma, you shot powerful arrows with your bow<br/>
and destroyed the iron forts of Lanka. <br/>
<br/>
845. You who are the life in our bodies,<br/>
our sleep and feelings, <br/>
the five things given by the cow,<br/>
the purity in all, <br/>
the sky and the earth, <br/>
the rich ocean and the things in it.<br/>
There is nothing without you. <br/>
You are our god and you are Rāma.<br/>
<br/>
846. I have destroyed the desires that come from the evil senses<br/>
cut off all the relations I had with others,<br/>
and I have come to you to serve you.<br/>
Even if you want me to have desires <br/>
and enjoy the pleasures of the five senses, <br/>
my only desire is to be with you.<br/>
I have no eyes except you,<br/>
O my king who rest on the ocean. <br/>
<br/>
847. You do endless magic. <br/>
Even if all the true seven worlds were to praise you <br/>
for all the seven yugas, it would not be enough,<br/>
O god worthy of limitless praise. <br/>
O Pundariga! Please give me a boon <br/>
so I may escape from all my endless births <br/>
and come to your ankleted feet. <br/>
<br/>
848. In your beautiful hands you carry <br/>
a discus, conch, club, bow and sword. <br/>
O lord with Lakshmi seated on a red lotus on your chest,<br/>
give me your grace so I will be saved <br/>
from the births that give sickness and sorrow.<br/>
Show me a way to come to you. <br/>
<br/>
849. I have left all the evil acts that I was committing<br/>
and now I have no cunning or fault,<br/>
none of the desires that the five senses bring. <br/>
I am like a dog and my only desire is to be with you. <br/>
O Māyan, give me the boon <br/>
of not being born and dying anymore  and I will not forget you. <br/>
<br/>
850. You, the beloved of Nappinnai,<br/>
have the color of the kāyām flower.<br/>
My soul is tied to you.<br/>
I hear that the messengers of Yama <br/>
encourage people to be involved in cruel sins,<br/>
but I have locked you up in my heart with Nappinnai<br/>
and you save me from committing those sins. <br/>
<br/>
851. You are Māyan whom no one can reach easily.<br/>
You save people even if they are evil, forgetting all good deeds, <br/>
thinking themselves wise and not understanding<br/>
that births cause them suffering in this world,<br/>
Give me your grace and make me your devotee<br/>
so I may worship your feet through devotion for you always. <br/>
<br/>
852. I want to ask you one thing,<br/>
O you who have the color of the ocean. <br/>
If I worship you and always want to think of you in my mind,<br/>
won’t you also consider giving me your grace<br/>
so I may keep your lotus feet in my heart forever?<br/>
<br/>
853. O Māyan resting on the ocean with seething water,<br/>
my love for you is limitless<br/>
and I worship your shining lotus feet in my heart<br/>
so that they will take away all my troubles.<br/>
You, the victorious divine hero, took the form of a boar<br/>
and carried Govardhana mountain <br/>
to save the cows by sheltering them from the storm.<br/>
O lord, tell me how I can not be born and suffer in this world.<br/>
<br/>
854. O dark-colored god with the beautiful Lakshmi on your chest,<br/>
You, are faultless, the god of gods<br/>
and the god of justice proclaimed by the Vedas. <br/>
Give me your grace <br/>
so I may recite your names without ever ceasing.<br/>
<br/>
855. O Māyan with many weapons in your strong arms,<br/>
who cut off the heads of the Asuras Vakkaran, Karan and Muran <br/>
when they came in anger to fight you,<br/>
give me your grace so I may always worship your feet <br/>
adorned with golden anklets <br/>
whether I am resting, standing or walking. <br/>
<br/>
856. You swallowed the earth, <br/>
and you begged for land and took it from Mahābali,<br/>
measuring it till there was no place you had not taken.<br/>
O lord with lotus eyes who embrace the woman<br/>
whose sweet words surpass music,<br/>
there is no other color like your color. <br/>
<br/>
857. O god carrying a conch, club, bow and a sword,<br/>
your discus cut off the head of Yama<br/>
when he came angrily to fight with you<br/>
and you carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows <br/>
when the storm came to destroy the cowherd village. <br/>
My heart loves nothing except your fame <br/>
that is spread everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
858. You destroyed the angry king of Kasi, <br/>
Vakkaran, Pavuṇḍran, the furious Maliman, <br/>
Sumali, Kesi and Thenugan.<br/>
I will not give my love and affection to anyone,<br/>
only to your anklet-adorned feet. <br/>
<br/>
859. Even if I received faultless boons<br/>
and could go to the world of Nanmuhan<br/>
filled with abundant and indestructible wealth<br/>
or the world of Shiva <br/>
who has the power of destroying the world <br/>
or the world of thousand-eyed Indra, <br/>
even if I could have all the pleasures of moksha, <br/>
I would not accept or think of anything<br/>
except to be with you. <br/>
<br/>
860. You became a dwarf <br/>
even though no one made you small,<br/>
and, without anyone making you bigger,<br/>
you became tall even though no one made you tall <br/>
and touched the sky.<br/>
All the sages recite the Vedas, <br/>
praise you and say that you are the god of gods<br/>
and you destroy the evil of the proud,<br/>
and I join them in your praise. <br/>
<br/>
861. You, Māyan, the pure one<br/>
wearing a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,<br/>
I, a dog, bow to you and worship you.<br/>
who are colored like the ocean and rest on the water of the sea. <br/>
You enter the thoughts of your devotees.<br/>
Forgive all my faults and give me your grace. <br/>
<br/>
862. You are the lord of the world.<br/>
Sages say that even they who slander you like Sisupalan <br/>
or fight with you like Ravaṇa in Lanka<br/>
have reached your world and joined with you by your grace O Māyan.<br/>
Take the mistakes that I, as low as a dog, <br/>
do as good deeds and forgive me. <br/>
<br/>
863. O my heart, time will pass,<br/>
we will all get sick and grow old <br/>
and the time of our death will come near.<br/>
Bow to the divine feet of the god and worship him.<br/>
You should know that being a devotee of the god <br/>
is the only good thing. Only  the feet of Thirumāl<br/>
can give you the joy of never being born again. <br/>
<br/>
864. When Nanmuhan cursed dark-necked Shiva <br/>
in whose matted hair the Ganges flows<br/>
and Nanmuhan’s skull was stuck to Shiva’s palm,<br/>
our god whose chest is adorned with a fragrant garland <br/>
gave his blood and made Nanmuhan’s skull fall away. <br/>
O heart, think of the god’s thulasi garland and worship him <br/>
so that you will reach his Vaikuṇṭam. <br/>
<br/>
865. O heart, if you want to remove the eight bad thoughts <br/>
and live without fault and reach moksha and rule the world, <br/>
you must think and worship the feet of the god, our father, <br/>
who is wisdom, the sun, and the world, <br/>
who took the form of a single-tusked boar and split open the earth. <br/>
<br/>
866. Our ruler and our mother, he destroys all our births, <br/>
makes us his devotees and gives us his grace.<br/>
O poor heart! He is Mukundan, the ancient one.<br/>
If we worship him he will enter us, stay with us<br/>
and remove our ocean of sorrow. <br/>
<br/>
867. Rāma the heroic one, went to Lanka,<br/>
fought with Ravana whose sword was mighty, <br/>
burned it, killed Ravaṇa and conquered Lanka. <br/>
My god does not think that I am like his enemies.<br/>
Yama will not think of the sins <br/>
I have done and afflict me<br/>
because I am a devotee of the god. <br/>
<br/>
868. He will take you to heaven<br/>
removing your fears, sickness, old age<br/>
and all your births.<br/>
Achudan, Anandan, the lord who fulfills his promises, <br/>
and has no beginning or end<br/>
rests on the snake bed<br/>
and is praised by the Vedas.<br/>
<br/>
869. O lord, beloved of Lakshmi,<br/>
I worshipped you with my words and in my deeds <br/>
and loved you unceasingly, <br/>
night and day, morning and evening. <br/>
My heart worshiped your lotus feet <br/>
and now it stays with you and will never come back to me. <br/>
<br/>
870. O Māyan with the color of a kāyām flower, <br/>
god of Srirangam surrounded by the Ponni river, hear me.<br/>
My heart has given up my bad karma <br/>
and worships your shining flower feet <br/>
remaining with them without ever growing tired. <br/>
<br/>
871. You, colored like a cloud, the everlasting shining light, <br/>
took away all my future births and saved me today.<br/>
You came to me, entered my heart and bewitched me<br/>
and now my soul has been released from all pain<br/>
and has attained moksha, the house of joy.<br/>

6. Thirumālai  :  Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi Azhvar  (872-916)</h3></center>
<br/>
872. You, the ancient one, <br/>
swallowed the three worlds and spit them out.<br/>
We do not like the feeling <br/>
that come from the enjoyment of our five senses<br/>
and we do not sin anymore.<br/>
The messengers of Yama cannot hurt us now.<br/>
We are brave because we have learned your names <br/>
and recite them, O god of Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
873. Your body is like a beautiful green hill,<br/>
your lotus eyes are handsome <br/>
and your mouth is red as coral.<br/>
O father, bull among the gods<br/>
and tender child of the cowherds,<br/>
I want only to praise you with these words. <br/>
I do not want anything<br/>
even if it were the gift of ruling Indra’s world,<br/>
O god of Srirangam. <br/>
<br/>
874. Even if a man lives for hundred years, <br/>
half of those years he spends resting.<br/>
Many he spends as an innocent child and as a youth<br/>
and the rest he spends suffering sickness, hunger, <br/>
old age and other ills.<br/>
I do not want to be born any more in this world, <br/>
O god of Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
875. When Kstrabandu suffered from bad karma, <br/>
he worshipped the god,<br/>
recited the three syllables of the word “Govinda”<br/>
and received moksha<br/>
but even though I continually worship Rangan, <br/>
the crazy god who gave his grace to devotees like Ksatrabandu,<br/>
he has not taken away my births. <br/>
<br/>
876. If people enjoy the pleasures of women<br/>
they will fall into many troubles. <br/>
They will get sick and suffer, unable to eat night and day.<br/>
Why do those base ones not become the devotees<br/>
of the god whose chest is adorned with cool thulasi garlands, <br/>
singing and dancing his praise? <br/>
They only enjoy the food they eat and do not realize<br/>
that worshiping the god is like drinking nectar. <br/>
<br/>
877. You build tall walls for your palaces<br/>
that have long porches and enjoy living in them<br/>
and you do not think at all of your next birth. <br/>
You do not become a devotee of the god Rangan <br/>
whose walls are dharma.<br/>
You decorate the exterior wall that is your body <br/>
and live inside it as if you were a bird <br/>
concerned with nothing else. <br/>
<br/>
878. If people learn the good religious books, <br/>
how can they hear, see and learn<br/>
about the dharma of the mean religions, Buddhism and Jainism?<br/>
If I think of any other god, <br/>
I promise that even if someone cuts off my head<br/>
I will not die because I am a devotee of the god.<br/>
The only god of gods destroyed Lanka with his bow.<br/>
<br/>
879. O god of Srirangam,<br/>
the bald-headed Jains, Buddhists and the Sakyas <br/>
hate our religion and say terrible things about you. <br/>
It is better if they get sick and die rather than living.<br/>
When I hear their evil speech, it hurts me.<br/>
If I could, I would cut off their heads.<br/>
<br/>
880. O ignorant men! Is there any other god?<br/>
You will not understand that he is the only god<br/>
unless you are in trouble.<br/>
You should know one thing for sure: <br/>
there is no god except him. <br/>
Worship the ankleted feet of our father<br/>
who grazed the calves.<br/>
<br/>
881. He created all the gods by his good grace<br/>
and showed Srirangam as the path<br/>
to those wishing to be released from their births.<br/>
O Nambis, listen. <br/>
The god riding the eagle is here,<br/>
but you look only for the wealth that is achieved by bad deeds.<br/>
<br/>
882. Our god, the protector of the world,<br/>
built a bridge on the large ocean, shooting one arrow,<br/>
and he fought with the king of the Rakshasas in Lanka. <br/>
You do not think of the beautiful temple <br/>
in Srirangam surrounded by forts,<br/>
and so you do not have good luck in this birth but waste your life. <br/>
<br/>
883. Once some people heard <br/>
Yama and Muthkalan talking together in hell<br/>
and thought that hell is heaven. <br/>
They forgot that the place of the many-named dear god Nambi <br/>
is Srirangam and they did not worship the god there. <br/>
They plunged into sorrow and I am worried <br/>
that they will have trouble in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
884. All the creatures of this wide earth <br/>
surrounded by oceans with rolling waves<br/>
worship the king of the gods in the sky<br/>
adorned with a fragrant blooming thulasi garland. <br/>
If ignorant people praise Srirangam, <br/>
all the hells that have been created for them <br/>
because of their enjoyment of the senses <br/>
will be destroyed and disappear.<br/>
<br/>
885. Beautiful Srirangam is surrounded with groves <br/>
where bunches of bees swarm around flowers, peacocks dance, <br/>
clouds float above in the sky and cuckoos sing.<br/>
Indra the king of the gods comes and stays there.<br/>
Such is lovely Srirangam.<br/>
You should take the food that the evil people eat<br/>
who do not praise Srirangam filled with beautiful groves<br/>
and give it to the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
886. The king of the gods with an eagle flag<br/>
is true for people if they think he is true<br/>
and he is false if they think he is not true.<br/>
If someone thinks he can escape birth<br/>
only by worshiping the god,<br/>
his doubts about the god will go away<br/>
and he will understand <br/>
that Srirangam is the Thirupadi of the beautiful god.<br/>
<br/>
887. I was a gambler and a thief. <br/>
I consorted with bad people<br/>
and was caught in the love-nets of fish-eyed women. <br/>
But the beautiful god said, “Come out!”<br/>
and entered my mind and made me love him.<br/>
Srirangam is the Thirupadi of the beautiful god<br/>
who made me love him.<br/>
<br/>
888. I don’t know how to praise you with my tongue<br/>
and I don’t have the good luck of knowing how to love you<br/>
or a good mind that knows how to glorify you. <br/>
My strong iron-like heart melted <br/>
to see the sweet sugarcane-like god <br/>
of the wonderful temple in Srirangam<br/>
surrounded with groves swarming with bees.<br/>
How my eyes were delighted when I saw him! <br/>
<br/>
889. My lotus-eyed god<br/>
rules the world, resting on the ocean <br/>
where waves break on the banks <br/>
and spray drops of water with foam.<br/>
My eyes that saw Kaṇṇan <br/>
with a red mouth as soft as a fruit shed tears. <br/>
What can I, a sinner, do?<br/>
<br/>
890. My father, the blue ocean-colored lord,<br/>
rests on the snake bed,<br/>
and as he rests his head is on the west side,<br/>
his feet are extended toward the east,<br/>
his back is turned toward the north<br/>
and he looks toward Lanka in the south.<br/>
When I look at him as he rests my body melts. <br/>
O people of the world, what can I do?<br/>
<br/>
891. The Māyanār who rests on a snake bed<br/>
in Srirangam where the water of the Kaviri flows over its banks,<br/>
has a beautiful divine chest,<br/>
strong arms, pure lotus eyes, <br/>
lovely coral lips and shining hair <br/>
and his body has the color of an emerald. <br/>
How could his devotees forget his beautiful form?<br/>
<br/>
892. O heart, you are humble <br/>
and you want me to make my mind one<br/>
with Rangan, whose mouth is red as coral. <br/>
You are strong and tell me<br/>
that I should always think of the god, beautiful as a jewel,<br/>
resting in the mountain-like temple of beautiful, precious gold.<br/>
Tell me how can I approach him?<br/>
<br/>
893. O heart, you may speak of him<br/>
but you cannot really know his greatness. <br/>
No one can know him unless they are faultless.<br/>
We can only worship him <br/>
who stays in the hearts of his faultless devotees. <br/>
O ignorant heart, can you speak of him? Tell me.<br/>
<br/>
894. Srirangam is in the middle of the Kaveri river<br/>
which is purer than the Ganges.<br/>
and its water rises and spreads through blooming groves.<br/>
Our dear Thirumāl, our Esan, rests there on the river.<br/>
How can I live forgetting him <br/>
after seeing him resting on the water of the Kaveri?<br/>
I am to be pitied, I am to be pitied.<br/>
<br/>
895. I see his beautiful lotus face <br/>
and I see how that thief who stole my heart<br/>
rests on the Kaveri in Srirangam<br/>
surrounded by a rising flood of water <br/>
and flourishing with groves.<br/>
O my heart, you are brave.<br/>
You know he is the one you really love,<br/>
but you love him secretly and spend your days<br/>
without telling anyone.<br/>
<br/>
896. I have not lived the life of an orthodox Vediyan <br/>
bathing and making sacrifices with three fires.<br/>
I do not understand myself<br/>
and I am not a devotee in your eyes. <br/>
What is there for me to be happy about?<br/>
O Nambi colored blue like the ocean,<br/>
I cry out for you. Show pity on me<br/>
and give me your grace, lord of Srirangam!<br/>
<br/>
897. I don’t worship your golden feet,<br/>
decorating them constantly with flowers. <br/>
Even though I have much time, <br/>
I don’t praise your divine qualities with faultless words.<br/>
My heart doesn’t know how to love you.<br/>
O Ranga, I don’t have the fortune of being your devotee.<br/>
What can I do? I was born in vain.<br/>
<br/>
898. I am like the innocent squirrel<br/>
that went to Rāma for refuge after rolling and immersing itself<br/>
in the wave-filled water as it tried to help the monkeys<br/>
when they took mountains to build the bridge for Rāma to go to Lanka.<br/>
My heart is as hard as wood and I am a bad person.<br/>
I have not served the lord of Srirangam with my mind <br/>
and am tired and wretched.<br/>
<br/>
899. Even the gods in the sky do not understand the radiant lord<br/>
who came to protect the elephant Gajendra<br/>
and grew angry at the crocodile that ate red meat. <br/>
Am I fit for him to come to me?<br/>
I am mean, like a dog and I have not served him. <br/>
What can I do? I was born in vain.<br/>
<br/>
900. I don’t belong to a village or own any land.<br/>
I have no relatives.<br/>
I worship the feet of you, the highest one, on this earth<br/>
and know no other refuge,<br/>
O you with the bright color of the dark clouds. <br/>
O Kaṇṇa! I cry out for you. <br/>
Whom do I have without you as my support?<br/>
Come and remove my sorrow,<br/>
you who are my mother, lord of Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
901. I don’t have a pure mind and no good words come from my mouth.<br/>
I get very angry, shout and say bad things.<br/>
You are adorned with fresh thulasi garlands,<br/>
lord of Srirangam, surrounded by the Ponni river.<br/>
Tell me, what will happen to me, O my king. <br/>
<br/>
902. O lord of Srirangam,<br/>
I have not done tapas like the sages, I am not wealthy,<br/>
and I am as useless as salty water for my friends and relatives.<br/>
I fell for women whose mouths are like coral<br/>
and became like dust when I didn’t have money. <br/>
You gave me this birth only to make me suffer.<br/>
<br/>
903. O Kaṇṇan with a body as dark as a thick cloud,<br/>
lord of beautiful Srirangam <br/>
where bees sing and swarm in the groves,<br/>
I don’t know even one path to take to see you.<br/>
I am a thief, I am violent, stupid and rough.<br/>
I come to you. You are my refuge.<br/>
<br/>
904. I stopped telling the truth<br/>
and fell into the passion of women with long hair.<br/>
I told only lies and now I have no refuge. <br/>
I, a liar, come and stand before you, O lord, Ranga,<br/>
hoping that you will give me your grace. <br/>
I am a liar, a liar.<br/>
<br/>
905 Thirumāl abides in my mind <br/>
but I am unable to understand that he is there. <br/>
I am a thief disguised as a devotee doing service.<br/>
When I realized that you are in the minds of those <br/>
who think of you and you know what they think,<br/>
I was ashamed and laughed so hard<br/>
that it seemed the bones in my chest would break. <br/>
<br/>
906. O my father who measured all the world with your feet,<br/>
I, a sinner, will not worship anyone but you,<br/>
the lovely-eyed Thirumāl, my soul, my nectar,<br/>
my father, as dear to me as my life.<br/>
I am a sinner, truly I am a sinner.<br/>
<br/>
907. When you were young<br/>
you carried Govardhana mountain to stop the storming rain,<br/>
O you who are like a sweet river.<br/>
I suffer, caught in the net of doe-eyes women—<br/>
why don’t you look at me and give me your grace?<br/>
I have no one but you. I call you,<br/>
O ancient one, god of Srirangam.<br/>
<br/>
908. The bright lord is my father and mother, <br/>
the god of Srirangam<br/>
surrounded by the clear water of the Kaviri.<br/>
I am a poor person. <br/>
My dear lord doesn’t show me even a little compassion,<br/>
he doesn’t think, “He is pitiful, I should help him.”<br/>
What is this, O lord, Isn’t this a terrible thing to do?<br/>
<br/>
909. You, lord of Srirangam surrounded by water,<br/>
are happy with devotees <br/>
if they abandon their wealth, understand divine truth, <br/>
know what will they be in the future, <br/>
control their five senses, shave their heads<br/>
and stay at your doorstep, living a quiet life.<br/>
<br/>
910. O lord of Srirangam<br/>
whose hair is decorated with a thulasi garland,<br/>
no one has to be born in a good family to become your slave.<br/>
Even if someone is born like a dog <br/>
and doesn’t belong to the families of Vediyars, <br/>
if he worships your feet ornamented with sounding anklets, <br/>
it seems you will be happy with him,<br/>
<br/>
911. O lord of Srirangam<br/>
with beautiful Lakshmi on your chest,<br/>
even if hunters kill animals cruelly, <br/>
burn and eat them, <br/>
if they think of you in their minds <br/>
and keep you there with love, worshiping you, <br/>
their bad karma will disappear <br/>
and they will not suffer.<br/>
<br/>
912. Even bad people who do evil things <br/>
and make others do evil deeds,<br/>
if they praise you saying, “You are the god of the sky.<br/>
Even the gods in the sky do not understand you<br/>
who are adorned with a thulasi garland<br/>
that swarms with bees,”<br/>
and if they become your slaves and offer food to your devotees, <br/>
they will become pure. <br/>
<br/>
913. Lord of Srirangam surrounded with walls, <br/>
you give your grace to all who worship you, and you tell them, <br/>
“Even if you belong to a low caste, you should recite the Vedas, <br/>
follow a faultless way of life and become my devotee, <br/>
mingling with other devotees, worshiping them,<br/>
giving them whatever they need <br/>
and sharing your things with them.”<br/>
Isn’t that the way you give grace to poor people<br/>
and make them worship you as your good devotees? <br/>
<br/>
914. O lord of beautiful Srirangam, <br/>
if even Vediyars of the highest caste<br/>
who recite the six divine Upanishads and the four Vedas<br/>
disgrace your devotees, <br/>
they will become Pulaiyars in a moment. <br/>
<br/>
915. Shiva with the Ganges in his matted hair <br/>
and Nanmuhan who did tapas for countless ages <br/>
could not see you and felt ashamed. <br/>
You came and gave your grace to the elephant Ganjendra, <br/>
amazing the gods in the sky. <br/>
Why do people think of you as their refuge<br/>
and hope you will remove their suffering<br/>
when you do not show your grace to all like me?<br/>
<br/>
916. Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi, the pious devotee <br/>
praised Kaṇṇan, Thirumāl, the god of Srirangam<br/>
who killed the strong well-fed elephant in flourishing Madurai <br/>
that has beautiful palaces decorated with coral.<br/>
If devotees recite his simple pāsurams <br/>
they will become his sweet devotees.<br/>

917. When the sun rises in the east from the peak of the mountain<br/>
and darkness has gone and it is morning<br/>
and all the beautiful flowers that drip honey bloom,<br/>
the gods of the sky all come before you to worship you. <br/>

You who carry a bow, the strong king of Ayodhya, <br/>

and worship your feet.<br/>
This is the temple where Vibhishaṇa, <br/>
the king of Lanka, worshiped you. <br/>
O dear god, wake up and give us your grace.<br/>
<br/>
922. Is this the host of suns riding on tall chariots decorated with bells?<br/>
Is it the troupe of eleven Rudras riding on bulls?<br/>
Is that the six faced-god riding a beautiful peacock?<br/>
All these gods and the celestial physicians and the Vasus are here,<br/>
while the other divine gods come on horses and chariots singing and dancing.<br/>
The crowd of gods is like a flood<br/>
and they have gathered in front of your temple that looks like a huge mountain.<br/>
O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace<br/>
<br/>
923. Is this the crowd of gods from heaven?<br/>
Is this the throng of sages doing penance <br/>
and the medicine men of the gods? <br/>
Is that Indra coming on his elephant Airāvata?<br/>
In front of your temple, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas<br/>
and Apsarases are all gathered together to worship you<br/>
and it seems as if there is no space left in the sky or on the earth.<br/>
O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.<br/>
<br/>
924. Some gods in the sky arrive with fragrances,<br/>
some carry huge pots of treasure <br/>
and shining mirrors and come to give them to you.<br/>
Good sages bring things suitable for you to wear<br/>
and Nārada comes with his Thumburu veena to play music.<br/>
The sun god rises, spreading his bright light<br/>
and darkness disappears from the sky.<br/>
O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.<br/>
<br/>

The sages, the gods in the sky, Saraṇars, Yaksas,<br/>
and Siddhas are all fascinated by the music <br/>
and come to worship your divine feet.<br/>
O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.<br/>
<br/>
926. Are these fragrant blooming lotuses?<br/>
Is this the sun god rising over the roaring ocean?<br/>
You are the god of Srirangam surrounded by a river<br/>
where curly-haired women with waists as small as tuḍi drums<br/>
bathe, squeeze their clothes,<br/>
and come out of the water to dress.<br/>
I am Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi, your poor devotee. <br/>
I brought thulasi garlands in baskets to decorate your body.<br/>
I am your slave. Give me your grace. <br/>

8. Amalan Aadipirān. - Thiruppāṇāzhvār (927-936)</h3></center>
<br/>
927. He, the faultless one, the king of the gods in the sky <br/>
who gives us his grace and makes us his devotees,<br/>
is pure, the lord of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills <br/>
surrounded with fragrant groves.<br/>
He is the god of justice in the sky, <br/>
and the dear one of Srirangam surrounded by tall walls. <br/>
His lotus feet came and entered my sight.<br/>
<br/>
928. He  is pleasant and joyful measured the world,<br/>
growing so tall that his crown touched the sky, <br/>
and as Rāma of the Kakutstha dynasty<br/>
he killed the Rakshasas with his cruel arrows.<br/>
My thoughts are immersed in the red garment <br/>
that adorns the waist of the god of Srirangam<br/>
surrounded by fragrant groves.<br/>
<br/>
929. Female monkeys jump everywhere <br/>
in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills in the north <br/>
where the gods in the sky come to worship <br/>
the lord resting on the snake bed.<br/>
He wears a red garment with the color of the evening sky<br/>
and above that is Nānmuhan whom he created.<br/>
His beauty is this devotee’s life.<br/>
<br/>
930. The ocean-colored god shot sharp arrows,<br/>
conquering and killing the ten-headed Ravaṇa, king of Lanka<br/>
surrounded by high walls on all four sides. <br/>
The beautiful ornament tied on the divine waist <br/>
of the god of Srirangam<br/>
where bees that drink honey sing <br/>
and beautiful peacocks dance<br/>
entered my heart and stayed there. <br/>
<br/>
931. Making me his dear devotee and entering my heart. <br/>
He removed all the bad karma that has burdened me all my life. <br/>
I don’t know what hard penance I could have done for this to happen. <br/>
The ornamented divine chest of the god of Srirangam <br/>
made me his slave and protects me. <br/>
<br/>
932. Our father, the lord of Srirangam<br/>
surrounded with groves where bees live<br/>
removed the suffering of Shiva <br/>
whose matted hair holds the crescent moon.<br/>
See, he swallowed all the earth,<br/>

and he gives his grace to me.<br/>
<br/>
933. He holds a curving conch in one hand<br/>
and a fire-like discus in the other. <br/>
He, resting on a snake bed,<br/>

<br/>
935. He  slept on a banyan leaf when he was a baby<br/>
swallowed all the seven worlds,<br/>
and rests on a snake bed in Srirangam.<br/>

<center><h3>
9. Kaṇṇiṇuṭchiṛuthāmbu. Madhurakavi Azhvar (937-947)</h3></center>
<br/>
937. I praise the god, the divine Māyan, my father,<br/>
who was tied by Yashoda with a small rope. <br/>
If I approach the place where the Nambi of south Kuruhur stays<br/>
and say his name, nectar will spring from my tongue.<br/>
<br/>
938. I praise him with my tongue and relish it.<br/>
I yearn for the golden feet of Nambi of Thirukkuruhur<br/>
and I know no other god but Nambi of Thirukuruhur.<br/>
I wander and sing sweet songs about him.<br/>
<br/>
939. Even if I have to wander all over, <br/>
I will go to rich Thirukkuruhur <br/>
and see the dark, beautiful form of the divine god.<br/>
If I go there and become a devotee of Nambi<br/>
that will be the most wonderful thing I could ever have.<br/>
<br/>
940. The excellent, orthodox Vediyars<br/>
skilled in the four Vedas<br/>
do not think I am a good person,<br/>
but Sadagopan Nambi accepts me <br/>
and he is my mother, my chief and my ruler.<br/>
<br/>
941. Before, I believed in the wealth of others<br/>
and beautiful women,<br/>
but today I have become a friend and devotee<br/>
of Nambi of Thirukkuruhur, <br/>
filled with pure golden palaces, and I dance there.<br/>
<br/>
942. My dear god gave his grace <br/>
so I could praise his fame from today <br/>
for the next seven births.<br/>
Nambi of Thirukkuruhur, <br/>
filled with hills that look like large palaces, <br/>
will not disgrace me.<br/>
<br/>
943. My chief Māṛan the son of Kāri <br/>
accepted me and made my bad karma go away.<br/>
I will tell the people of all the eight directions <br/>
of the grace I have received <br/>
from Sadagopan, the wonderful Tamil poet.<br/>
<br/>
944. He sang a thousand sweet Tamil pāsurams <br/>
through the grace of god<br/>
and described the meaning of the divine Vedas<br/>
so that his devotees praise the blessings <br/>
that he received from the god. <br/>
His giving his blessing is the best thing in the world.<br/>
<br/>
945. He described the meaning of the Vedas <br/>
that the best Vediyars know and recite.<br/>
My chief Sadagopan praised by all <br/>
made me learn the Vedas.<br/>
To be his devotee and to serve him <br/>
is the greatest love I can receive. CHECK<br/>
<br/>
946. Nambi will accept anyone as his devotee <br/>
whether or not he receives benefit from him, <br/>
even if he is not his friend. <br/>
The Nambi Thirukkuruhur<br/>
surrounded by beautiful groves where cuckoo birds sing<br/>
will change him and accept him, and keep him with him. <br/>
I am striving to receive the love of Nambi, <br/>
worshipping his ankleted feet.<br/>
<br/>
947. Nambi of south Thirukuruhur, our friend, <br/>
is the friend of all who approach him.<br/>
If devotees believe in Madhurakavi’s words,<br/>
they will see Vaikuṇṭam and abide there.<br/>
