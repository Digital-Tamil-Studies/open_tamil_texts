 Introduction 

 The Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam and the Thiruchokkanaathar Ulaa. 

	The Thiruvilaiyaadal puraanam of the fourteenth century tells the sixty-three miracle stories of Shiva in Madurai. Through the stories the author tells us the genealogy of many Pandyan kings, the history of Madurai city and how it was constructed, many wars between the Chola and Pandyan kings, the three times when the deluge came, the establishment of the Sangam with forty nine poets in Madurai city and many other details. 
	The author of the Thiruvilaiyaadal puraanam is Paranjothi Munivar. He was born in the city of Thirumaraikkaadu in the Chola country. His father Meenakshisundara Desikar belonged to Vellala caste.  The author learned both Sanskrit and Tamil and became a scholar in both languages. When he grew up he went to Madurai to worship the god Sundareswarar and goddess Meenakshi.  Meenakshi appeared in his dream and asked him to write stories about the miracles of Lord Shiva and so he composed the Thriuvilaiyaadal Puraanam and read it in the assembly of Pandyan king. Scholars say that he lived in the 16th century CE. 
	Some scholars believe that the stories of Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam follow the Sanskrit “Haalaasyamaahaatmyam,” while others believe that Paranjothi Munivar’s work came first. The stories of Shiva in this book also occur elsewhere in Tamil literature in such works as  Cilappathikaaram, Kallaadam, Thevaaram, Thiruvaasagam and others. Other works  that describe the Thiruvilaiyaadals of Shiva are Perumpatrap Puliyur Nambi’s Thiruvaalavaay Udaiyaar Tiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam,  the Kadambavana PuraaNam, the Sundara Pandiyam and others. 
	Thiruchokkanaadar Ulaa: This Ulaa describes the greatness of Shiva and his escorts in procession in the first part. In the later part of this Ulaa the seven types of women who see Shiva in his procession tell us the same sixty-four stories that are told in Thiruvilaiyaadal Puraanam. The author describes the beauty of each of these women and their love of Shiva in this prabandam.
	The purpose of this translation is to make available to the western world one of the finest prabhandams in Tamil. I will be happy if this translation is useful to those scholars who are working on later Tamil genres and religion. I should convey my sincere thanks to George Hart for going over the English. I would also like to thank my student Gita Pai who awakened my interest in the various Prabandams about Madurai city. I would also like to thank all my students who give me encouragement in all my efforts.

Praise of Shiva, the ancient Lord

1, 2. Vishnu, the beloved of Lakshmi

the way, the deeds and the form of 
Shiva the ancient Lord

He is the first one. 
He has no beginning or end.
No one can see his head or feet.
Such is his form.

is the princess of the Himalayas.
The Vedas always search for her.

That Goddess of Madurai 
embraces the chest of her beloved Shiva.

showered down a cool and 
fertile flood of Tamil poems

and as lord of the Vaigai river, ?

took the form of a snake 
so that the man-lion form of Vishnu 
stopped trembling and became calm.

17. Shiva burned the three forts 
with a slight smile without anger
because all emperors who protected the lands 
requested him to burn them.

Indra comes to the earth and consecrates a Shiva Lingam

he made a flying chariot,
came to earth and consecrated

112. The women of the earth 
who had reached heaven 
crowded in the sky to see the Lord. 
The women on earth all

113. Numerous women beautiful 
as lustrous valli creepers

small golden peaks of a high hill.

looking like the dancing girls

coming on a vehicle in the sky.

the procession of the highest Lord.

117. The women who gathered 
on the wide streets praised 
and worshipped lovingly 
the feet of the Lord. They said, 

118. “The Lord grew angry with his wife 
when she was born on the earth 
with three breasts and fought with her.
Isn’t it a joke if our breasts 
love to embrace his arms?

119. “When his beloved wife attracted him
and loved him, he also loved her. 
Won’t that kind Lord 
show pity on us?

120. “The saint Patanjali requested the Lord 
to dance at his wedding 
and the Lord did.
Does the Lord come 
on this divine procession 
only to see the love war of Kama?

121. “The Lord appeased the thirst 
and hunger of Gundodharan
at his wedding.
Isn’t it his duty to give us 
his grace who fell in love with him?

to grow loose from the pain of love
to give his fragrant garland to us?

126, 127. “Indra worshipped 
the Lord of Thiruvaalavaay 
with fragrant flowers, 
nectar and the water of Ganges river. 
Won’t our tears be the water for his bath?
Won’t the bangles of our hands 
become garlands for his bed? 
Won’t our hearts be nectar for him?”

128. They went near him without fear.
They laughed impulsively.
They stood mesmerized.
They said, “The Lord who, like Kama,
kills us with love is coming.”

129. They stood as if they were going 
to say something but they could not.
They learned from their friends 
what they should say 
to the omnipresent Lord 
but they forgot it.
They were confused and worried. 
130. They said, “Do our ornaments 
grow loose, 
offerings for the husband 
of wonderful Shakthi, 
who shines like a diamond creeper.”

their clothes grew loose on their bodies.
They felt ashamed 
when the flower arrows sent 
from the sugarcane bow of Kama 
covered their bodies.

132. Different types of women stood there 
to see the procession.
The pethai, a young girl 
who wished to help Kama, 
was among them.

The Pethai

133. The pethai was young as a Puvai bird 
that had not learned Kama’s scripture.
She was a creeper 
not yet grown and spreading.
She was a garland 
not yet dripping with honey.

134. She was a fragrant mango 
that had not yet bloomed. 
She was a diamond
that had not been worn.
She was a lovely baby cuckoo 
that had not yet uttered its cry.

135. She was a vanji creeper 
that had not yet branched.
She was a lovely breeze
blown from the hills.
She was a fresh fragrant grove.

136. She was a babbling parrot 
that did not know 
what was right to say 
and what was right to do.
137. She was not yet grown 
like the crescent moon.
She was a young swan 
that does not yet know 
how to separate milk from water.

138, 139. Her breasts shone like 
lustre of many suns 
that will rise at the end of the earth.
Those small breasts 
did not know their power
of destroying the sky 
and the earth. 

140. 141.
The pethai’s hair was disheveled,
its strands loose and scattered
like the wandering senses of those 
who lead false lives and are unable 
to reach the lotus feet of the all-knowing God
who carries a bright axe
and rides on a strong bull.

142. Her eyes did not yet know how to make trouble.
They were like the minds of those 
who are released 
from the illusions of the world 
surrounded with oceans.

143. Lord Shiva is God of gods.
He burned his enemies’ 
three forts as they flew in the sky.
He is the king of Madurai 
that is praised by scholars. 

144. The victorious Southern Pandya king
who wore fragrant garlands
gave abundant pearls 
to people on the entrance of his palace.
The pethai went to that 
lovely entrance with her friends.

145. Bringing abundant, 
matchless pearls 
she went to the pandal decorated 
with coral pillars on the street. 
146. She built a small dollhouse 
with many types of pearls. 
She cooked rice with pearls 
without knowing how to cook at all.

147. She fed her parrot, mothers, friends 
and the baby doll in her hands. 
Such was her sweet nature.

148. She taught words to her Puvai bird, 
the most marvelous among birds,
pretending that she instead was learning 
words from them. 

149. One day when her mothers went 
to the pandal of Madhavi flowers
she also went with them.

Eight miracle stories of Shiva

150 - 153. The pethai listened 
carefully and lovingly 
to the stories of Lord Shiva’s miracles.

bringing the ocean 
to please his beloved Shakthi.

giving moksha to Shakthi’s father 
to please her who is decorated 
with elegant bangles.

154, 155. She with her puvai bird 
and the parrots of the fields
listened with love the stories and 
the thiruppatikams of the three saints 
that give moksha to those who hear.
At that time musical instruments 
were played to announce 
the procession of the Lord.

156, 157. Musical instuments praise the Lord 

“He is a marvelous dancer

fascinated to see the Lord.

and said to her mothers, 

160. “Oh, swan, Oh Puvai bird, 
Oh peacock of the forest,
Oh, beautiful parrot, 
Oh doll, look at him here.

161. “Has the Lord 
who loves the deer he holds in his one hand 
and the parrot he holds in the other 
come here wishing to join
and play with us?

162. “Does the Lord come near 
my little play-house because 
he wants to eat our food 
or learn how to play the game of kalangu 
that I have learned”

163. “Please tell me
what the Lord who cannot be 
described by anyone intends.”
This is what she asked her mothers. 
and they embraced her and said,

164. “Is it right if you say the highest Lord 
who did sixty-four tiruvilaiyadals 
will come to play with you?

165. “He does not take the sacrificial food 
given to him by the Rishis, 
who are excellent scholars of the great Vedas.
Will he come for the simple food 
that you have cooked?

166. “Is it fair to say 
the eternal one 
who dances in the silver hall 
will leave his important duties 
and come here to learn 
to play kazangu? 
Wouldn’t that be a miracle?”
167. When the mothers said this 
she who was lovely as a deer asked, 
“Then why did he come here?”

168. They answered, 
“Oh girl, lovely as a creeper!
The Lord who performs five surpassing actions 
comes in the procession 
to give joy and moksha to all lives.”

169. The pethai asked, “Please put me
on the radiant chariot 
of the eternal lord 
on whose red jata the Ganges flows.”

and her heart weakened, 
like those who fall in deep love.

171, 172. The mothers said

the garlands on her hair.

that covers the whole world
and helps kama to finish

that grow tall

who love, understand and melt 
in devotion for the Lord who has thick Jata

grow thick and embrace the beautiful naakaa trees
that look like the kings
who wish to embrace 
the chest of the Lord of Madhurapuri
creator of the Vedas
who rides on a sky chariot. 

197. “Come to this pond 
where the water of
all the great oceans

the boon of seeing his divine form.

with a shining crown 
as the sages on earth 
praised her.

She was precious wealth.

that all the lands in the directions 
of the earth could not be 
as wide as they were.

341, 342. Her forehead was like the bow 
that Kama carries and
her hair was decorated 
with a lovely, fresh garland
that was like Kama’s flower arrows
and so her dark hair, buzzing with bees,
was like the form of that god of love.

343. If she wore shining 
golden ornaments on 
her breasts they would look 
like two golden Meru mountains. 

344. If she wore chains studded 
with diamonds and 
pearls on her breasts 
they would look like two silver hills

on her breasts that 
attract hearts of everyone,

Kama danced and 
even Yama was entranced.

and straining her thin waist 
even more than before.

sent by strong warriors 
to tear the chests

her long, big dark 
eyes wandered 
all over the world 
like the messengers 
sent by angry Yama.

to take away the life of anyone they saw.

the tandam weapon 
of cruel Yama
that takes away the lives 
of those who live in this world.

she had for that garland
made her pain even harder to bear.
353. One day she came 
to a garden blooming with lovely flowers. 
She was surrounded by Kama
who carries flower arrows
and many crores of her friends 

354. She saw the Themaa tree and felt happy.
She asked her friends, 
“Why do I feel happy 
when I stay in the shadow of this Themaa tree?”

355. Her adoring friend 
who was as tender as a flower, 
told her,
“Lovely one! 
You are as precious as our life.
You are like sweet nectar.”

356. “A long time ago, 
the Lord embraced his wife 
the goddess Uma, lovely as a deer,
and the mother of all seven worlds,
under this Temaa tree

357, 358. “and her breasts and her bracelets 
marked the faultless chest of the Lord. 
Don’t you know, that is the reason 
that you are drawn to this tree 
whose flowers drip honey.”
Listening to this the arivai 
became shy and was filled with shame.

359. She asked her friend,
“Do you know any other trees 
where the generous Lord likes to stay?”
Her friend said, 

360, 361, 362. “My friend, you who have have dark fragrant hair, 
the Lord likes to stay in many trees— 
the banian tree, the Makiza tree, 
the lovely Thillai tree, the Aatti tree, the Kuraa tree, 
the Marutu tree, the Paalai tree, the Palaa tree, 
the white naaval tree, the Paadalam tree,
and the beautiful MarukkonRai tree.
The Lord Chokkanadar stays beneath 
the sacred Kadamba tree 
in the city of Thiruvaalavaay, 
praised by all.”

363. When her friend told the arivai
all the trees beneath which Lord Shiva stays,
the arivai’s heart and her long wide 
lotus-like eyes were pleased. 

364. She went near the Kadamba tree and 
asked for refuge under it.
She worshipped the tree 
and said with love, 

365. “The Lord is escorted 
and worshipped 
by the gods Vishnu and Brahma.
The great Vedas praise him.
The scholarly sages rejoice to see him.

366. “Your blossoms decorate his Jata.
You have the fortune 
that he stays beneath you.
You are equal to Shiva’s abode.

a garland of kuvaLai flowers, 
and say its fragrance is for you.
They bring sweet-smelling water 
and say it is for your bath.
Oh, Lord, why won’t you tell me 
how I can be bold enough 
to serve you?

came and made my desire for you 
even greater.
If it comes again as it did yesterday 
how could I bear it?

are hot fire to burn me.
The sandal trees on the hills 
burn me with fragrance they send.

or do all others feel the same way?

and are proud that you possess gold.

to fight with him?

so thin you could not even see it—
her breasts took care 
that her waist not be hurt.

wished to embrace the Lord

her lovely light color.

take away the darkness of the night 
instead of the moon?
Can you tell me the reason?”

said this to her friends, 
a virali holding the yaaz 
folded her lovely hands together, 
bowed to her said, 

474, 475. “The Lord is compassionate.
He is the king of the kadamba forest.
His beautiful mouth is like a red lotus.
His shining teeth are like jasmine flowers.
His beautiful eyes are like sahoraa birds.
His arms are bright like the sun and moon.
You have the right to embrace his arms.

476. Hearing what the Virali said, 
the perilampen replied, 
“You are decorated with precious ornaments.
I would like to listen to the music 
of your yaaz sweet as nectar.
Please play.”

to Sundarar who fell 
in love with Paravaiyaar in Thiruvaarur.
You grant boons to gods and others.

508. “You gave them all gold 
so that they could survive.
But you only gave me pallor 
that has the color of gold.
How am I to live?

509. “The goddess embraces 
your chest lovingly.
If you embrace us also, 
the mark of her body 
on yours may disappear.

510, 511, 512. “You wear a flower garland
on your Jata that belongs to Ganga
and a flower garland on your left side
that belongs to Uma, and because of them

1. The story of Shiva selling firewood:  In the rule of Varaguna Pandya there was a singer named Emanathan who played the yaaz. He came to Madurai from Northern part of Pandya country and lived there. The Pandyan king appreciated his music and gave him many gifts. The singer proudly proclaimed that there was no one as good as him in the whole country. The king asked Paanapathran, a singer in his assembly, to compete with Emanathan, but when that singer heard how well Emanaathan’s disciples sang on the street, he worried that Emanaathan would defeat him. He prayed to Shiva and went home. Lord Shiva decided help him by chasing Emanaathan away. The god came disguised as a seller of firewood seller. He sat on Emanathan’s patio and began to sing. Hearing Shiva’s divine music, Emanathan came out and asked him who he was. Lord Shiva told him that he was a humble disciple of Paanapathran. Emanaathan thought that if the disciple of Emanathan was a such good singer,  he would not be able to compete with Emanathan himself. That very night, he ran away from Pandya country. When the king and Paanapathran realized Lord Shiva himself had come and sung, they were pleased, went to the temple and praised the god. (41)

2. The story of Shiva giving wealth to Paanapathran. Paanapathran spent all his time singing the praise of Shiva and did not do anything to make money.

After standing on it and singing, the rain stopped and he went home. The king heard about Paanapathran’s devotion and granted him much wealth.(43)

4. The story of Paanapathran’s wife competing with another singer: The king Rajaraja Pandyan had a mistress. She was a good singer and did not like the singing of Paanapathran’s wife. She brought a singer from Lanka who played the yaaz and asked Paanapathran’s wife to compete with her. Those who heard them realized that Paanapathran’s wife was the better singer but when the king praised only the singer from Lanka everone agreed that the singer from Lanka was the better singer. Lord Shiva wished to help Paanapathran’s wife and came to the competition disguised as a singer. The king realized that God himself had come as a singer and worshipped him. The king declared that Paanapathran’s wife was the winner. Everyone was happy and the king gave presents to both of the singers. (44)

6. The story of Shiva making the piglets ministers: Shiva came in a dream of Rajaraja Pandyan and told him, “I have fed twelve piglets and they will become men with pig faces.

The bird was afraid of all the stronger words, worried that they would hurt it. It went to a forest and stayed on a tree all the time without going anywhere.

The eight miracles of Shiva in the section of the therivai

1. The story of Thiruvaalavaay city. After Suguna Pandyan, twenty-two kings ruled the Pandya country. At the time of the king Keerthibhushana Pandyan the seven oceans deluged the land with water. In Madurai, only the temple of Somasundarar and Meenakshi, Rishabja mountain, Yaanai mountain, Naaga mountain and Pasu mountain were not destroyed. After the flood stopped, Lord Shiva created the world again and the three Tamil kings—the Pandya, Chola and Chera dynasties—were created by Shiva from the gods Moon, Sun and Agni.   After Keerthibhushana Pandyan, Vangiyasekara Pandyan ruled the country. He wished to build a large city but did not  know what the boundaries of the city were before the deluge. He prayed to Shiva to show him the proper boundaries of the city. Shiva asked his snake to show by encircling the city and the snake did as the god wished. After that, the snake requested Shiva to name the city after him, and so it was called, ‘Thiru Vaalavaay city’. (49)

2. The story of  Shiva helping the Pandyan king in the battle: At the time of Vangiyasekhara Pandyan a Chola king came to fight with him. As the Pandyan king’s army was small he was losing the war. He prayed to Shiva for help. The god came in the form of a hunter, joined the Pandyan army fought and killed hundreds of Chola warriors. The Chola king saw an arrow with the name of the god written on it and realized that Shiva was fighting for the Pandyan’s army.  He left the battlefield and went back to his country. The Pandyan king gained victory and ruled his country happily. (50)

3. The story of Shiva giving the Sangappalahai: Once, the god Brahma went to bathe in the Ganges with his three wives, Saraswathi, Savitri and Gayathri. On the way Saraswathi stopped to listen to the sweet music of a Gandharva girl and Brahma bathed in the Ganges with his two other wives. Saraswathi was jealous that Brahma had not waiting to bathe with her. The god said angrily, “It is your fault that you did not come with me. You will be born as a human being on earth.” Saraswathi asked her husband to forgive her and he said, “Your body is made of fifty-one letters.  Of those fifty-one, forty-eight will be born as poets in Kudal city and compose poetry. The chief poet will be the god Somasundarar himself. You will live in the hearts of those poets and give them power to compose poetry.”  This happened as Brahma had ordered, with Somasundarar being the forty-ninth poet. The king built a Mandapam for the Sangam and asked Shiva to give a Sangappalahai for the poets. All the forty-nine poets, including Paranar and Kapilar, sat on that palahai. After that Vangiyasekara  Padiyan crowned his son Sudaamani Pandyan and went to Kailasa. (51)

4. The story of Shiva helping Dharmi receive a bundle of gold: Vangiya Sudaamani Pandyan had a flower garden from which he took flowers to worship Shiva. One day his wife came to the garden and smelled a new fragrance there. The king wondered whether the fragrance was from the flowers or was a natural fragrance of the hair of women. He announced to the poets, “If any of you bring me a poem that will remove my doubt I will give him a thousand gold coins.” Many poets tried but none could help the king. There was a poor poet named Dharmi in Madurai and he went to the temple and prayed to Shiva to help him. Lord Somasundarar wrote a poem and gave it to the poor poet. Dharmi went to the king and read the poem. The king was happy and decided to give him the gold, but Nakkirar, a famous poet in the assembly objected that the meaning of the poem was not correct because women’s hair does not have  any natural fragrance, only the fragrance of oil and flowers that women wear in their hair. Dharmi went to the Shiva and the god came to the court of the Pandyan king and argued with Nakkirar. When Nakkirar realized that God himself wrote the poem he asked for forgiveness. Shiva was angry and opened his forehead-eye. Nakkirar was burned, went to the temple pond and stayed there (52)

5. The story of Shiva blessing Nakkirar: The poet Nakkirar  sang many songs and praised Shiva. Shiva and Parvathi came to him him and blessed him. Nakkirar joined the Sangappalahai and composed many poems. (53)

6. The story of Shiva asking Agastya to teach grammar to Nakkirar: Nakkirar joined the Sangappalahai and composed many poems. Shiva thought he did not know Tamil grammar well and asked the sage Agastya to come from Pothiya mountain and teach grammer to Nakkirar. Agastya came down from Pothiya mountain and taught gr Nakkirar. After learning Tamil grammar Nakkirar taught other poets. (54)

7. The story of Shiva making peace among the Sangam poets: The forty-nine poets in the Sangam were proud of their own poems and boasted. They prayed to Shiva to reveal to them who the best poets were.  Lord Shiva came to the Sangam disguised as a poet and told them, “There is a boy named Rudarasanman who is the son of Dhanapati and Gunasaalini. He is dumb and cannot speak. If you read your poems to him, he will tremble and shed tears when he hears a good poem. Then you will know who are the good poets.” The poets did as Shiva had asked, reading their poems and finding out whether they were good by Rudrasanman’s reaction. This took away their pride, and afterwards they worked hard to compose good poems. (55)

8. The story of Idaikkaadar: After Shanpaga Pandayan’s rule, fifteen kings ruled the Pandya country. At that time of Kulesa Pandyan, Idaikkaadar, a friend of Kapilar, composed a poem, came to the king and read it, but the king did not show respect to the poet. Idaikkaadar went to the temple, worshipped and told Shiva what had happened. The god left the temple with his wife and stayed under a banian tree on the north side of the Vaigai river. When the king did not see the gods in the temple, he worried and ran to the tree and the god told him that he should respect Idaikkaadar. The king asked the god and Idaikkaadar to forgive him. Lord Shiva and Parvathi returned to the temple and after that the king treated all the poets with respect. (56)

The eight miracles of Shiva in the section of the perilampen

1. Shiva catching a whale: One time when Shiva was reading the Vedas, Uma did not listen. Shiva became angry and cursed her to be born in a fisherman’s family. When Uma asked the god to forgive her, Shiva said, “I will come and marry you when you reach marriageable age.” Uma was born as a daughter to a fisherman.  When she had grown up, her father was searching for a bridegroom for her. At that time, Nandi deva came to the earth as a whale and caused problems for the fishermen. The father of Uma announced that he would give his daughter in marriage to any man who could catch the whale. Shiva came in the form of an young fisherman and caught the whale. The whale became Nandi and went to Kailasa. Uma’s father gave Uma in marriage to the young fisherman. The bridegroom and the bride changed their forms to Shiva and Parvathi and blessed all the fishermen. (57)

2. Shiva giving his grace to Manivaasagar: When Arimarthana Pandyan ruled the Pandya country, he had a minister named Thiruvaadavurar. Once the king gave some gold to Vaadavurar and sent him to buy horses. On the way in Thirupperundurai, Vaadavurar saw Shiva in the form of a teacher with his disciples. He stopped at the school and sang praising lord Shiva. Shiva was pleased and gave him the name Manivaasagar. Manivaasagar spent all the money that the king had given for horses on service to Shiva’s devotees. When the king did not get his horses he sent a letter asking Manivaasagar why his horses had not come. Manivaasagar asked Shiva for help, and, advised by the god, he sent a letter to the king assuring him that he would receive his horses soon. (58)

3. Shiva changing some foxes to horses: Angry that he had not received the horses he sent Manivaasagar to buy, he imprisoned Manivaasagar. Shiva changed some foxes to horses and took them to the king’s palace disguised as a horse seller. Shiva told the king, “You take all the horses. Once I give you these horses they are yours. Release Manivaasagar from the prison now.” The king did as Shiva asked. (59)

4. Shiva changing the horses to foxes: In the night all the horses that Shiva brought changed into foxes and ran all over the city. People suffered and worried. The king angrily asked his servants to throw stones at Manivaasagar. Shiva decided to save Manivaasagar and the Vaikai river flood all over Madurai. The king could not control the flood and asked the people of the city to carry sand and put it in the river to stop the flood.  At that time Shiva came to the river disguised as a worker.  (60)

5. Shiva carrying sand for Vanthi, the old lady: There was an old lady named Vanthi who made pittu and sold it for a living. When she could not carry sand to put it in the river, the king’s servants threatened her. Vanthi prayed to Shiva to help her. The god disguised himself as a worker, came and told her, “If you give me some pittu I will do the work for you.” Vanthi happily complied. Shiva ate the pittu and went to sleep. When the king came there, saw Shiva sleeping and hit him with a stick, all the people of the Pandya country felt the stick strike them. The god appeared to the king and said, “You imprisoned my devotee Manivaasagar.  You should realize that he spent all the money you gave in my service and release him.” The king released Manivaasagar and asked him and Shiva to forgive him. After that Manivaasagar went on many pilgrimages and praised Shiva with his beautiful songs. (61)

6.  Shiva curing the disease of a Pandyan king: A Pandyan king named Kun Pandiyan who had conquered the Chola and Cera kings married the daughter of a Chola king named Mangaiyarkkarasi. The Chola king sent his minister Kulachiraiyar to stay with Pandyan king with his daughter. When the Pandyan king adopted Jainism and caused trouble for devotees of Shiva, the god gave a disease to the king. The queen and the minister were devotees of Shiva and asked Thirunyaanasambandar to come and cure the king. Sambadar accepted and when Jain sages prevented him from coming to the Pandya country intervened so that he could come to Madurai and see the king. Sambandar praised Shiva and asked him to cure the king’s disease. The god did so and the Pandyan king became a devotee of Shiva and did great service for Lord Shiva (62)

7. Shiva helping Sambandar in the debates that he had with the Jain sages:  The queen and the minister asked Sambandar to stay in the Pandya country and spread Saivism. Jain sages asked Sambandar to compete with them by seeing whose poems would remain unharmed.  The Jains wrote some spells on palm leaves and put them in a fire, but they burned. Sambandar put his poems in the fire and they did not burn. Then the Jains put their spells written into the water of the Vaikai river and they all sank into the water. When Sambandar put his poems in the water they all floated. Since the Jains were defeated, they died.  After that Sambandar went on many pilgrimages and praised Shiva with his songs. (63)

8. Shiva helping a woman to protect her chastity: A merchant decided to marry his uncle’s daughter in his village and was taking her back to his village. On the way they slept under a Vanni tree where there was a Shivalingam under a tree. There was a well nearby.  The merchant was bitten by a snake and died. Sambandar came there and saw the merchant and his wife. He prayed to God, restored the merchant to life and told them to get married in front of the Shiva lingam. They did so and went to the merchant’s village.
	The merchant had married another woman before he married his uncle’s daughter. That first wife tormented the younger wife saying, “Who knows who you are? How do we know you are married to my husband?” The younger wife went to the temple and prayed to Shiva, “Oh, Lord, the Shiva lingam, the vanni tree and the well where we were married were witnesses of our marriage. Please make them appear here to prove that we are married.”All the three came to the east side of the temple. The people saw them and praised the chastity of the younger wife. She lived with her husband happily after that.(64)
